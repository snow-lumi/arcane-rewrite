# The People's Arcane

## Prologue
## (Vi)

In the dark scene where it appears on the screen lies the ash that covers everything while a lullaby sung by a little girl offstage is heard.

♪ Dear friend across the river ♪

Then he appears in reddish hue inside a bridge that is being illuminated in flames and ashes of fire freshly comsumed, the bells he hears from the ship lying from underneath the same bridge.

♪ My hands are cold and bare ♪

It changes the scene drastically in the form of a psychological horror, focused on the statue of a sculpture that is part of the bridge. The screams of horrors are heard from some people outside the scene.
♪ Dear friend across the river ♪

It changes the scene drastically in the form of a psychological horror, focused at the entrance of the arch of the bridge, covered by the fumes of the flames.

♪ I'll take what you can spare ♪

Leading from the scene chamber down to the thick part of the soot where the fumes are found. It shows an explosion that hit a person in the silhouette that showed behind the curtain of thick smoke, with an agonizing scream. That part of the explosive was scribbled with white crayons. Possibly it is under the perspective of a little girl singing that lullaby. With a buzzing sound behind the explosive, he hears loud footsteps approaching in silhouette a spelunating man.

♪ I ask of you a penny ♪

The spelunating man, it turns out, is a Enforcer who is firing his explosive ammunition shotgun at point-blank range at a dying person on the ground who is being silhouetted in a pile of flaming smokescreen.

♪ My fortune it will be ♪

It changes the smoke screen much darker where it appears from a silhouette illuminated by fire away from the scene the Enforcer. A bunch of scribbles under the girl's perspective showing the face of the Enforcer, masked, grotesque figures of sharp-toothed monsters, illuminated by the flames and the change of gloomy focus. The Enforcer pulls out the bullet casing of his shotgun, focusing straight ahead with reddish illumination and he goes through it without doing any harm within the girl's perspective.

♪ I ask you without envy ♪

Now the camera takes under the perspective of the girl in first person looking at a pile covered with smoke and ashes of fire consumed on the bridge.
aise no mighty towers ♪

Among the flames, pile of dead bodies lies while she in the first person walked it.

♪ Our homes are built of stone ♪

Between a frame shift that is felt as the girl's perspective becomes distorted, some scribbles cover the eyes of said dead man on the bridge.

♪ So come across the river ♪

Now the camera focuses on the two girls, one an older pubescent girl with a boy's tendency older pubescent girl with a boy's tendency and the other an infant girl infant girl who is covering her eyes while singing that lullaby where the prologue of the episode began.

Infant girl Infant girl: (singing) ♪ And find... ♪ (she stopped, opened her eyes to see her older pubescent girl who happens to be her older sister)

The older girl exhales and gasps at the horror she is experiencing in the fountain, the camera focuses on the two girls, the infant looking straight ahead and exclaims. Looking at what they see, rumbling sounds caused by fire crackling on the bridge strips of corpses shod and thrown apparently an attempted coup to wipe out the Enforcers that was a resounding failure.

The camera focuses on the infant shaking hands with her older sister for fear that this could happen to both of them. The older girl exhales when she hears the metallic noise from far away. The camera focuses on what the older girl looked at, in silhouette a muscular man muscular man is beating a supposed Enforcer with his gauntlet.

The muscular man sheathed heavily as he stopped him, glaring angrily and turned to the two girls, breathing, taking time to process head on. The infant girl steps back to the side with her older sister, the pubescent girl fixed on him as the gust of wind is heard. The muscular man slowly approaches the two girls, a worried look on his face accompanied by the somber music. Making a nonverbal expression to the older girl, "and who are you accompanying". The girl looks around the bridge, she is referring towards herself by the muscular man's nonverbal question she has something she feels some guilt, she closed her eyes for a second and looked to the right side pointing for the girls to see them.

When the camera focused on a silhouette of very thick smoke on the ground, it focused on the place when the smoke curtain dispersed: there was a dead violet-haired woman with open eyes from the front. The infant girl felt a shiver, feeling in her dry and dirty cry on her face looking at her older sister. The pubert girl was shocked, she exhaled, recognizing the woman lying dead on the floor. The music became more melancholic, she starts to cry. The infant feels sad to feel that her older sister had felt what she did when she started to cry

The muscular man recognizes the situation: the dead woman on the floor turns out to be the supposed mother of the two girls. The older girl falls to her knees with crying and heart broken in two, the infant younger sister of the older girl comforts her and hugs her older sister with her inaudible crying. The muscular man is facing the two girls closely after learning of their loss, he looks briefly at the dead woman from afar and then at his makeshift metal gauntlets.

Out of the scene, he takes out the two gauntlets and throws it to the ground by showing on the camera on the ground, feeling the shock of falling at this instant. The melancholic music continues showing on the camera the statues of the bridge had to red color by the flames. Showing the next scene the muscular man carrying the two girls in his embrace. Focusing towards the three, being the blue-haired tired infant, the muscular man carrying the load for the two and the older girl from behind her body where her perspective observes them the paronama that the bridge left: death and violence, when he looked at the rest of the other fallen covered by a reddish flaming smoke curtain, some Enforcers from far away observes him while the rest of his fellow anti-rioters leave the stage. The older dark fuchsia-haired girl feels a grudge against them.

Suddenly, under the perspective of the older girl, look over the bridge where the smoke curtain did not cover the skies, there is the picturesque town belonging to the Piltover Crest icon Piltover which is being at dusk that will soon be covering by the same smoke from the fire.

## Powder

In the main scenario, years have passed since it happened in the interlude. The older girl appears all grown up as she climbs the wall of a two-story building, moaning in the effort, and in the out-of-focus camera she manages to climb up to the next floor. Now he manages to focus the camera as she speaks her words downwards.

Violet Violet: We're almost there.

The camera focuses on the rest of the children, as she is the one directing it: the grown-up infant girl in the blue and purple semi-masculine clothes grown-up infant girl in the blue and purple semi-masculine clothes, a sturdy boy with his aviation goggles on sturdy boy with his aviation goggles on, and a dark-haired boy with thick eyebrows and tousled upward hair dark-haired boy with thick eyebrows and tousled upward hair. Everyone is being carried out of the building by her.

Claggor Claggor: Aw, man. (grunts)

The camera focuses on top of the building cliff, on the roof, where the fuchsia-haired girl manages to reach the top of the building, which then waits for the rest. After exhaling, she immediately says to the person who is about to arrive.

Violet: Hey, Powder.

The blue-haired girl, whose name is Powder, is the second to arrive, listening to her older sister's words.

Violet: (Off-camera) Come take a look. (Powder grunts upon arriving when he noticed his respondent's response)

Violet rests on top as she waited in the presence of her little sister who arrived at the top of the city of Piltover.

Powder Powder: (looking at the overview) Whoa.

Violet: It's nice getting above it all, huh?

The camera moves away from the two, with an epic music where the panorama of the city of progress called Piltover is concentrated. Picturesque city, in front of the main town hall, a glass house, some bronze astronomical spheres above the study house, some airships from far away, all in a clear sky and clouds from the coast of the city. Claggor arrive from the back.

As the three of them looked at the city, a blimp came through the sky at full speed from near the three of them. Now the focus is on children.

Powder: One day, I'm gonna ride in one of those things.

Appears on the scene at dark-haired boy with thick eyebrows and tousled upward hair.

Mylo Mylo: And one day, I'm gonna shoot one of 'em down. (signals for a shot at the blimp, but Violet stops it in disgust)

Violet moves away from the camera to the front.

Claggor: Vi, are, are you sue about this?

The camera zooms out in a overview between the buildings, but keeps focused on the four boys from there.

Claggor: Look, if we get caught, we're--

Violet: We're not gonna get caught.

Lower the building to be on the other one on the roof.

Violet: We'll be in and out before anyone notices.

Sounds of screeching seagulls apartment, now concentrating on the overhead to move forward. The four boys stop.

Violet: All right, everybody, follow me. Just don't look down.

Violet parkours down the roof to gain momentum to jump to the other side of the building over there. Between grunts of effort, she manages to arrive without difficulty. The camera focuses on the three who are ready to jump, starting Mylo taking it like a piece of cake, their fingers growl. In between his grumbling, he takes some time to leap like a frog and makes the target, Claggor also made it from off camera while he is eating a raspberry cupcake he had in the open window.

Claggor: (saying to Violet) Couldn't we have at least just walked there?

Violet: Gotta stay out of sight for this one. (She looks towards her younger sister from far away on the other side of the building)

The camera focuses on Powder who is breathing heavily at her nervousness. The wind can be heard in gusts.

Mylo: (From far away on the other side of the building's roof) Called it. (He now focuses the camera on the three of them, speaking his words toward Violet) This is on you, Vi.

Violet: (Groaning with discomfort)

Claggor: I'll get her.

Violet: No! (Camera focuses close to Violet, directing the words at Powder forcefully) Powder, look at me. (Now focus on Powder overcoming fear while Violet's voice is heard from far off camera) What did I tell you?

Powder: That... (exhale) ...I'm ready.

Violet: (Off-camera) That's right! So? (Powder inhales and exhales)

Powder sets up the parkours so she can jump the building, she yells at the little carelessness but manages to stop for a brief moment, grunts and yells to continue on the roof. She jumps in the window and clips the roof above her, he pounces her with his hands and feet.

Powder: Phew!

Then, she sets him up to boost the jump at that point, I look down a bit, releasing some of the powder. The camera focuses from below on Powder. She looks away and jumps with all her strength, at first she makes it to the other side of the spot but she loses her balance. At the point she falls, her older sister Violet, decides to grab the arm of her little sister Powder who moans as she tries in vain to control her balance. Powder gasps as she is about to fall, but Violet manages to grab her. Powder exhaled. She looked at her older sister relieved to save her life.

Powder: Thanks.

After a brief second, Violet retrieves her younger sister and all four are present on the roof. Violet grunts and Powder pounds the ruckus. For a brief glimpse, they decides to continue the adventure. Mylo makes a mocking gesture to Powder for the almost failed jump to the other side of the building.

In the other scenario, continue to the fours above the building reaching the final destination. He hears from below a lot of indistinct chatter. The camera focuses on the foursome hovering on the rooftop mural that is near the target building, breathing hard so as not to fall to the ground while they are climbing forward on the roof.

Claggor: What if Vander Vander finds out we're all the way up here?

Violet: (Off-Camera) Look around you. (Now focus on her) You think anyone topside's going hungry? Besides, this is exactly the sort of job Vander would've pulled when he was our age.

The camera zooms out paromatically from below, the birds sing, they watch from below, possibly the destiny has arrived. Back from up close to the four boys.

Violet: (Leading the rest of her group) I'm going. Are you with me or not?

The camera focuses on the three of them, two of them respond with a grimace and the next answer breaks the ice.

Claggor: (Sighs) Vander's gonna kill us.

The camera focuses to another side, from Powder in the back to Violet in the front.

Violet: Yeah, only iff we screw up. (The camera focuses on the face) So don't screw up.

Now Violet goes down the roof of the building destined to the balcony on the top floor, she grunts as she turns around, pound as she leaves from the roof of her footsteps to go down to the last as she stands on the balcony. First, she assumes in the room in the window door, listen to the ticking of the clock inside, which is a workshop with gear and scrolls. Then, she warns the rest that there is no one in that room.

Violet: All clear.

Mylo takes a deep breath as he tries to climb down to the balcony outside the building. When he gets down, Mylo tries unsuccessfully to open the window door of the balcony to the workshop.

Mylo: (Groans) Who locks their balcony?

Él baja un poco para enfocar en la cerrajero de la puerta con su herramienta que abre las llaves de cualquier tipo.

Mylo: (Locking in the door with the locksmith) Hmm.

The camera focuses on the rest of the boys, Claggor helped Powder to get safely onto the balcony. Powder grunts and greets her big sister. Claggor grumbles in disbelief as he reaches the last one.

Claggor: Whew. (He looks down from the balcony of the building, the camera focuses on the view, apparently guarding a group of Enforcers guarding the perimeter.) There's tons of enfprcers down there.

Camera changes the focus from outside the door.

Violet: Means we're in the right place. (Addressing Mylo) You gonna get that door open any time soon?

The camera focuses on Mylo from the side viewpoint.

Mylo: Working on it. (Pulls his tool from the door) Seeing as I'm the only one who knows how to pick locks, I suggest--

Violet grunts loudly and from the fixed camera when she kicked the door open in the process. She enters and Mylo startled him in a moment. Claggor grumbles and shakes Mylo's head as a sign of how slow he was. Powder enters the door.

Mylo: Animals.

He stands up and the 4 boys look at the workshop where they entered. Noises of gear, an ominous musical atmosphere, they walk around to marvel at what is in this room. Violet is the one who takes the lead and puts down her backpack, looking at the board and the bookcase full of books, she approached, looking for some of these books. Claggor walked over, looking at Violet. She grabbed one of these books and saw a small glimpse to conclude what she is analyzing the room's property. Mylo approached at the workshop table.

Mylo: You know, Claggor, for once you're right. (Now the camera is fixed on him, looking at the wonder of this place from the workshop table) We are definitely not supposed to be here. (Floating from his hands he begins to extract all that glitters) Hmm. (Start booting your robbery sack)

Claggor also searches the workshop when he opened the banner on the other table. Each of them is extracting just like Mylo. Powder looks for something that catches her eye, among the racks of a stack of books, there is a carousel horse toy that she took as a souvenir. Violet looked at the blackboard again with a bronze piece in her hands and says a few words.

Violet: Must be an inventor.

The camera focuses a second time on Powder looking for more interest, and found on a valdiani decorated with jewels and sapphire. She fixed towards the object.

Powder: Whoa, I think this is a real Valdiani. (She opened by pressing on the button above the object, opened it listening to a little music from the box with the bronze and gold-plated star turning)

Mylo: (Off-Camera) Oh, yeah? What about this? (The camera focuses on the hand he is holding, the object is nothing more than a functional nose hair trimmer)

The camera focuses back on Powder.

Powder: That's a nose hair trimmer.

Violet appears from the left of the screen.

Violet: Keep an eye out for anything that look valuavle, Powder. (Her younger sister closes the valdiani with her hands, the camera focuses on herself) Before Mylo fills the bag with junk.

Mylo used the nose hair trimmer to his nose when I hear that he is accumulating this object as garbage, so he throws it on the ground as if it were something of no value. He walks, watched a few shots. The camera fixes when Mylo pulls out these papers when I hear a buzzing vibration, a bluish blue crystal held in a conductive container, a spark of low energy comes out.

Mylo: Uh.. guys? (The camera fixed on him and the two boys minus Powder when he answered the call to the blue crystal, Violet moved a little closer)

Claggor: (Setting to the crystal) Wait, Vi, how the hell did we find this place? (Mylo touches the crystal just for the spark to come out and receives it by grunting the harmless electricity)

Violet: It was a tip from Little Man Little Man.

Mylo: (Turns it over) Little Man?

Violet: Just leave it. (The camera now focuses on Powder away from the boys in search of another haul inside this house, listening to his older sister's voice before leaving for a short time alone) Come on.

Claggor: (Out of focus) How can anyone have so much stuff? (Powder will venture out on its own in search of higher house value)

Mylo: (Off-camera) Simple, just get born lucky.

The scene changes inside the inventor's bedroom, Powder ventures out on her own. Powder opens the door, click of the locksmith's knob, it was unlocked. She enters like a curious girl. I look around, humming. She took out a small gold-plated gold piece and kept it in its case on her belt. She pulled out from the top of the bookcase a book she had found, opened it and saw a small glimpse of pages, suddenly Powder, turning her head a little, gasps in surprise as she finds two freshly made and appetizing sandwiches to be eaten by a poor semi starving person standing on a blue plane.

Powder: (Off-camera) Woo-hoo!

She looks happy, walks over and without thinking twice, takes the sandwich and starts to eat.

Powder: (Munches) Mm.

Suddenly, she stopped out of curiosity, she looked at the blueprints being covered where she found the sandwiches. Powder pulls out these plans. A mysterious music appears softly, it was a chest on this desk table in the bedroom. Powder tries to lift that chest, but it was too heavy to lift at her young age. She grunts from the effort, but to no avail.

Powder: Huh.

She looks for how to open said chest, when she succeeds, she heard a clicking and rattling noise, and the chest door opens in a mechanized manner. Seeing that, Powder sees that it contains in the chest a sample of the same blue crystals that shines, stacked, with 4 of them out under the protective grip.

Powder: (Off-camera, whispers) Whoa.

The camera fixes the contents of the chest, Powder pulls out one of these crystals. The camera fixes on the curious blue-haired girl, the music of mystery continues, she observes her, analyzes her, when she approached that crystals closely, the gray eyes shines changing the hue of her irises in bright blue. She peeks at it, the reflection of the asymmetrical crystal towards the girl was amazed by the curiosity to find the biggest haul she had ever imagined.

On the other side of the room, the boys are still extracting in the main workshop while making noises to the objects to find an object of greater value, Violet is checking her backpack of loot, Mylo is throwing a spherical chest of bronze and semiprecious stones to the leader of the group. Suddenly, outside the apartment, Violet hears distant chatter in the background of the stage, she heard that conversation from outside, also hears footsteps approaching the door of the entrance of the inventor's apartment.

Clicking of the door knob is heard. Violet reacts quickly, and stands up.

Violet: (Whispers) Mylo. (He grunts slightly as he pulled up the chair from the main workshop desk)

Mylo grabs the same chair he sat in and takes it to the door to block the passage that immediately came the inventor who wants to return to his study room. The door is locked, the inventor in offstage tries to open the door which is being forcibly blocked by Mylo. Violet runs into the hallway to warn her younger sister Powder.

Violet: (Whispers) Powder, we gotta go.

In the other scene in the inventor's bedroom, Powder was heard by the voice of her older sister, who gasps in surprise and concern.

The inventor The inventor: (Off-stage, muffled) Hello? Is someone in there?

As the inventor said offstage, Powder quickly collects all the crystals in the chest and takes it with her. When she stowed the most crystals in her pouch on her belt, one of them had fallen on the floor. The camera focuses at slow speed a thunderous and unstable that may be that crystal that Powder had unintentionally dropped abruptly, spark and bluish energy comes out. To the other scene, Violet picks up her younger sister Powder with all the rush that had happened in a short second, both gasps from running too fast. Back from the glass being rolled for a brief second. At the door outside the balcony, Mylo and Claggor are waiting with the door open.

Mylo: Come on. (Violet and Powder grunts desperately)

The camera focuses from the side on the locked door at the entrance of the inventor's apartment, when he desperately and forcefully tries to force open the door, which was locked with a chair clamped on the knob. Back from the crystal being shot at a normal speed per camera shot, chimes were heard caused by the rumbling noise due to the unstable nature of material that is made of bluish crystal. Change the scene quickly with the 4 boys.

Violet: (Whispers as she desperately gathers all the loot in the sacks and backpacks to be taken away) We'll be fine. Just get back on the roof.

In a close shot when the door is about to force open, in the other scene the crystal is about to crash into the wall from under the bed, the crystal was impacted in slow motion, cracks come out from the impact, the energy becomes more powerful about to explode. Cuando Violet recoge el saco del botín desde el taller para poder salir en el balcón, un explosión fuerte de tonalidad azul surgió en la escena. The boys outside the workshop were hit by the explosion, Powder screams. In a parochrome shot, the building that resides in the inventor's apartment is spewing out a strong blue smoke from the explosion accompanied by lightning of uncertain origin caused by the impact of the glass that turns out to be unstable after all.

On the floor of the three boys on the balcony, Powder gasps and groans from inhaling the smoke from the explosion, Claggor and Mylo grunts from the impact the blast had left on the sore floor. Suddenly, Violet emerges unharmed from the explosion outside the apartment, she checks on the rest of her group, she hears cracks in the ground on the other side of the balcony, near the blast impact zone, she turns to see what the hell had happened. The building cracks with a loud crack of lightning coming from the impacting glass. Violet recoils from the shaking.

Violet: (Grunts) Hold on!

The instability of the blast-damaged building begins to tear apart the damage it caused. The camera focuses from below on the officers being watched from close to the building.

Officer 1: Whoa! Look out!

Debris begins to fall on the ground from three floors from the inventor's apartment.

Officer 2: (The officers run off, while he grunts in an effort not to get hurt) Watch out!

Falling debris covering the dust-filled scene of the destruction of the room. The camera focused on the impact zone of the building that had already left all the debris on the ground, Violet zoomed in to see the area of collateral damage, only to be discovered by the officers being watched at the scene and a bystander who was unharmed by the damage they unintentionally did by stealing from the apartment.

Officer 1: (Looked up) Hey.

The camera focuses on Violet with a reaction that was discovered by these officers.

Violet: Shit.

The alarm was activated in the form of a train horn, alerting the rest of the officers. Violet heard that honk, and leaves the site. In the outskirts of the city, the honking continues to be heard from a trumpet attached to a building. The 4 boys run from the city, splashing water on the ground while running.

They run through the crowd behind 3 Piltover officers known as Enforcers.

Enforcer 1: (Grunts as he run, shouting towards the 4 boys outside the camera) Stop right there! (As he says in a loud voice, he prepares a non-lethal ball grenade to be thrown at the boys fleeing from the law)

The grenade was launched, with a sophisticated technology, but it failed to hit the target when it rolled on a lamppost. There is a massive outcry during the persecution.

Enforcer 1: (Off-camera, from afar) Get them off!

The 4 boys pass through a main square that in Piltover is known as the Zindelo's Incognium from a paronamic point of view. The camera focuses on the boys again.

Violet: (Shouted) Faster!

Powder screams about the fact that they still pursue. The 4 boys arrived at the staircase where they hurried down, Vi jumped without stepping on a step and Mylo slipped on the stair railing.

Passerby man: (Off-Camera) Hey! Hey!

Passerby woman: (Among crowds) Look out!

As the audience watched as he passed between the 4 boys and the enforcers, he had thrown the ball unsuccessfully from outside the camera to the ground near Powder, causing a metallic clack. In slow motion, from an upward point of view, two more Enforcers from the traffic bridge are caught witnessing the 4 boys and join their colleagues to chase the inflators.

Enforcer 1: (Off-camera, grunts while chasing after the 4 boys) Down there! You can't get away! (Meanwhile, these 2 Enforcers passing on the bridge did not react when they crossed under it)

In the other scene, the 4 boys arrive at the point of the bascule bridge (that appeared in the prologue) that connected between the two cities, the tension music is still playing and you hear seagulls squawking. Violet looks back as she is running with her group, she propels herself to one of the passerby, she grunts for hurting but still runs without difficulty. The bridge begins to open with the intention of stopping the 4 inflator boys from the city, all 4 breathing heavily during the run. Focusing the camera on the point of the bascule bridge, they taking an impulse, jumped off without a problem when the bridge is about to open for the passage of some transport ships as in a vain attempt to stop them.

Enforcer 1: HEY!

Enforcer 2: Come on!

When each of the Enforcers jumped, one of them broke down while trying to jump and is holding on to the tip of the mouth of the bascule bridge.

Enforcer 5: (Grunts) Oh. (Suddenly, due to the slippery material, he falls into the water from a height of 25 meters)

For a brief overview time, a steamboat passes under the swinging bridge with its mouth open, the tension music continues. In another scene, in a neighborhood little explored by the Enforcers from another side of the city, the four boys cross over to these streets.

Violet: This way! (the four boys panting from the effort of running)

Enforcer 1: Keep going! (one of them tries to catch Mylo to capture unsuccessy)

Violet crashes into the wall to go through a tight alley between the building, both her and her younger sister grunts from the impact. Claggor and Mylo grumbled as well for hitting the wall to change direction, a few balls that the Enforcers threw towards Mylo could not be caught and hit the wall that the boys managed to get through in that alley. The Enforcers try to get through the alley. The 4 boys continue running panting in the effort to continue escaping from them, Violet breaks some bronze pipes that are connected to the hot water with the intention of being able to escape from the Enforcers in a successful way, since that ended up distracting by the steam that comes out. The four boys enter another secret alley.

Mylo: (From a distance) Go, go, go! (Mylo pushes Claggor when he broke down while trying to enter that secret alley that is too narrow to pass through)

The Enforcers stopped running, one of them touch from inhaling the steam that Violet had broken in the pipeline, the other tries to look for some feature to be able to disperse around the rest of the perimeter, so he resumes the chase. In a dirty place with fly was the chute driver that is closed in a sloppy grating, the guys open causing a loud metallic click, Violet is that opens that thing, grunting to enforzar with force to open, he succeeds and leaves the lid on the ground. Since that thing is dirty, Mylo reacts the following.

Mylo: Oh, man, not again. (Makes a disgusted face as he approaches the pipe entrance to the spillway) I just got this shirt-- (He yells as Violet kicked to enter Mylo forcibly)

In each scene, he slides down a slippery slide that is the pipe leading to the chute, Mylo nauseates from the front, Powder screams at the speed of the fall, Claggor shouts from the downward view, and Violet protects the slide to avoid injury on impact as well as to guard the booty sack. Each of them grunts for spraying the gunk that was on that improperly made slide they slid down. They arrive at the end of the slide, at the landfill. Mylo arrives first, then Claggor who hits Mylo and rolls down, Powder is the third and hits the softest zone with metals and the last one is Violet after Mylo speaks in the first place.

Mylo: Thought last time was the last time we were gonna do this.

Violet: (Camera focuses from far away) Well, this time's the last time.

Claggor: Guys, what was that? what the hell happened back there?

Claggor pointed out that it had happened in the inventor's room that they had to escape from the Enforcers that was triggered by the explosion that they had not expected from the normal, pointing to the suspicion to Powder. She has fixed the attention of the group to her explosive caused.

Powder: I don't know. I didn't do anything.

Mylo: (Camera focuses on him) You could fill a damn library with all the things you didn't do.

Violet: Guys, we just emptied a Piltover penthouse right under the enforcers' noses. (She rose to her feet after resting on the ground with garbage on top of her) So, if you're done beating yourselves up, let's get this home.

In another scene coming out of the landfill, it got to the afternoon hour. Apparently having escaped from the Enfocers, Violet is the first to leave, to hold in the arms of her younger sister Powder, Claggor picks up the loot to be picked up by group leader Violet. In a scenic cut, crowds of people talking in the background in a dangerous but cautious place, most of them minors smoking at the wrong age. The four boys were on their way to their home at the end of the dangerous part of the street, a few henchmen called one of them who was in the background to warn him and take his place. Violet is still in the lead, Powder observes in good humor of her companion Claggor hugging of satisfaction on the shoulder of the Mylo grumbling of the uncomfortable of squeezing of 'good friend'. Suddenly, a blond-haired thug appears sitting on the wooden box when they crosses the boys' path.

Blond-haired thug Blond-haired thug: Nice haul?

Mylo: You could say that.

Blond-haired thug: (Off-camera) I heard there was some action across the river.

The four boys stopped.

Blond-haired thug: (Now the camera focuses on him, playing the coin in his left hand) Someone, uh, someone really kicked the nest, huh?

Violet: Is that so? (Turns back to continue her trajectory, but suddenly stopped)

The boys had been surrounded by two boys from the blond bully, coming from the dangerous back of the street.

Blond-haired thug: (The camera focuses on him, again. Rises with chuckles. Now the camera takes a paranorama between the 4 boys and their thug henchmen) But now you're, tou're tracking this mess of yours through my streets.

Violet: Your streets? What makes you think--

Claggor: (He disrupts it by approaching the blond-haired thug) Listen, we don't want any trouble, okay?

Shaved thug: (Camera focuses on him) Hear that, Deckard Deckard? They don't want any trouble. (Deckard approached him)

Deckard: You know, in my experience, trouble finds you. There's no reason this has to get ugly. (The camera focuses on a paromatic point of view between 4 boys against Deckard and the 3 henchmen) How about you share a little taste of your treasure there and we'll call it even?

Mylo: (Camera focuses on the kids) No, no, no. We worked too hard to... (Violet appears and interrupts her, and takes her in Mylo's arm. She walked forward toward Deckard)

Violet stood facing Deckard, with an apparent downward glance, and responds menacingly.

Violet: Just a taste?

Deckard: (Camera focuses on him) Just a-- (Violet attacks by surprise, howls the pain of the first blow and falls to the ground)

Violet throws the sack of loot at Powder quickly. Mylo and Claggor reacts to fight, Deckard gets up, the shaved thug attacks Mylo and tackles him to the ground, taking the beatings. Powder walks away from the fight; Claggor for his size can with all the screaming pick up another thug without difficulty with his two arms and throw himself to the ground, and then kicks him. Powder feels fear, something reminds him, paralyzes him, he whimpers. Violet expertly blocks a frontal attack from Deckard, they both grunt, he pushes him but he responded by a left from the leader of the thugs.

In a slow montage, Violet takes the blow, spittle splashing out of her mouth. Powder watches carefully away from the fight, hearing foreboding music in the scene. Mylo still takes the beating from the shaved thug, but manages to recover with a right hand, with a grunt that comes out a little blood, Mylo stands up in a screaming rage that makes him raise his fist to hit hard the shaved thug who is on the ground. Powder hugs the sack of loot in terror, following along with the foreboding music in the background of the scene, dragging him to the ground. Claggor can even with two of Deckard's goons, by one he is held by the thick arm, and by the other he was knocked down by a hard kick. In a paranorama, Powder is in the center as he sees the violence of the fight when the rest of the guys manage to control the fight to Deckard and his henchmen, where Claggor still overpowers one of the henchmen and throws him to the ground.

The camera returns to normal speed, where in one of Deckard's henchmen who is on the ground, grumbling in pain, now focuses attention on Powder with his sack of loot in his arms. The blue-haired girl gasps in surprise, so she decides to run away, dodging the fight that the rest of the guys are beating up. Powder runs with his sack of loot carried as a backpack, being chased by one of Deckard's henchmen. Meanwhile, Mylo counters the shaven-headed thug who returned one of the attacks, snarling in front of the exchange of the beatings; on the other hand, Violet moans and coughs from Deckard's low blow that was checked by a hook upwards, leaving Violet in the rubble, only to retake with an attack that allows him to throw and grab Deckard's arm with full force, feeling an intense howl of pain and throws her into the same rubble, and finishes her off with a strong kick that destroys the rubble box with Deckard's body, Violet spits on the ground, wounded in her right eyebrow. Claggor was thrown to the ground as he was overcome, only to pick up a ground with his hand to throw the thug from the bottom, screeching pain in the eyes, which Claggor responds with a finisher making a tackle that sends the thug out of the fight using with a powerful suplex improvised. Mylo is having more difficulty in beating Deckard's third thug, which Violet looks for what to stop with: there was a split wood from the box of the scymbro cause of the recently previous fight, she pulls it out and whips it hard into the face of Deckard's shaved thug. Violet checked the head of the shaved thug, satisfied that Claggor already took care of the other thug, she decided to walk away from them with the 2 of her boys when she saw Deckard lying on the ground.

Mylo: This day's turning out all right after all.

As Mylo said that sentence of satisfaction, Deckard stands up to pull out a handmade tin knife.

Deckard: Wait!

Violet paused as she listened from the back. She turned her back, the guys also stopped, decided to approach without shame or fear towards him. Without reaction, she approached before a defeated and sore loser Deckard who is wounded of his mouth and gums, approaching from her head face to face, saying while fixed the gaze of the knife edge.

Violet: Wanna see how that ends?

Deckard desperately tries to restrain himself in fear before an Violet reacted to the threat, whose camera fixes on her who is approaching the tip of the knife of the defeated thug in front with a look of rage and intimidation. With a suspenseful music, Deckard hesitates his weapon feeling frightened of his defeat, picks it up and walks away, running out of the scene. The boys looked at the overview with a doubtful and bruised face, Violet asked the boys.

Violet: Where's Powder?

In the other scene, Powder is still running away from one of Deckard's thugs who was following her without knowing that the guys didn't warn of her presence, jingling from his swag bag as she ran hard. The thug had pushed a hermit out of the place as he ran, Powder passed on a debris in the hope that he can stop by throwing that debris, which stopped him for a brief time.

Chubby thug: Oh! Oh! You little... (Grunt from the pain she received)

In a dirty and polluted water corridor canal, Powder arrived to escape when she went through the boxes of debris that was used as a blockage, because it is blocked by the cargo boxes when crossing on the other side, she gasps in surprise and desperation that ended up hiding behind the wall of fear that it will not be seen by the thug that recently arrived, she sits down. By stumbling, she dropped a board that caught the thug's attention, she is aroused, she decides to try some gadgets that Powder made: an improvised personalized nail pipe bomb with mouse drawing that she has on her belt while the thug is walking over there. She desperately primed the grenade and stirred it up.

Powder: (With eyes closed, praying, whispering) Come on, Mouser, I need you!

She throws the improvised grenade called Mouser to roll towards him, who stood still in the face of uncertainty and the grenade manages to explode, with Powder biting her upper lips in nervousness, only to end up that the grenade is nothing more than a failed pink smoke bomb that the bully pushed away believing it would be harmful or lethal.

Powder: (Off-camera) No. (The thug laughs briefly)

Powder breathes with difficulty before the imminent beating of said thug who is approaching her alone, she retreated to the wooden fence that is near the polluted canal on the other side of the city, she continued breathing before the fear that without thinking she decides to take the bag of loot from her back and throws it into the water in the depths, the thug could not grab the bag and splashes it in the dirty water. Off-camera, Powder rushes away from him with her hurried steps to escape the thug who was breathing in frustration at not getting what he expected, disappearing from the scene as he tries to search for the feature. The squawking of seagulls could be heard in the background, and the camera moves to the water's opaque reflection of the full moon's glow.

## Vi

Mylo: (Off-scene) You did what? (Now the scene focuses on the four boys at night outside a deserted house, with the camera fixating between an annoyed Mylo and embarrassed Powder face to face)

Powder: I'm sorry. I tried to fight him off with Mouser, but... she didn't work.

Mylo: (Now, the camera focuses on the group) Who saw that coming?

Claggor: We never should have gone over there.

Violet: (Approaching Powder) Doesn't matter. The stuff's gone. (She pats his younger sister on the shoulder in disappointment at the fact that) It's all right, Powder. At least you're okay.

Mylo: Okay?! What about us? (As Violet opens the door to the abandoned house, he continued to speak) I get my face bashed in, and she just gets a pass? (The boys entered the house)

Violet: (Off-camera, before arapeciera) Yup.

This abandoned house contains a secret elevator on the deck inside a standard, activated by a lever, which Violet pulls the fulcrum making a metallic tinkling sound. The elevator comes down with the 4 boys. Mylo looks at a chagrined Powder who was at the center of the failure as she dumped the sack of loot from the inventor's house.

Mylo: Every time. Every time she comes, something goes wrong. (He leaned close to Powder's ear) She jinxes every job. (Powder reacted badly to Mylo)

Violet: (Off-camera) Just drop it, Mylo.

A foreboding music is heard in the scene as Violet continues to wait at the front of the elevator, making a brief glance as she focuses on what she will explain towards her final destination: her home.


# Vander? REWRITE NECESSARY

The Undercity, a city of underground, greenish air pollution, people of different class status and rich street culture, Violet is aware of her home and the people around her, so she puts up her hood of her sweater. The elevator arrives in the commercial street of the place surrounded by many people among merchants, bums, extravagant people and foreigners. Mylo takes advantage of a careless and sleeping merchant of a free fair to steal a fruit. Violet continues walking in front of her companions, passing an ambulant from outside the city muttering in a foreign tongue, a dealer in rare specimens with cages of small living rocco living rocco living beings that the same dealer beats to calm the captivity, a vendor of bladed weapons and knives, a brothel of dubious taste for the adult public, the latter of which makes Claggor turn away from the dreadfulness of the place, at the same time a pantless drunk man is brought out of the same brothel caused by a quarrel inside it.

Brothel woman: (Off-scene) Come on, get out of here! You gotta pay!

Pantless drunk man: Look at that! (Pantless drunk man lawsuit is prepared for the causer who threw out the brothel)

The scene focuses on a bar called "The Last Drop" with a beer stein logo in the middle. Inside the place with indistinct chatter, whose muscular man from the interlude muscular man from the interlude, now as a barman and owner of place, is pouring a two beer in a wooden pitcher for a foolish client with glasses foolish client with glasses who brings to the table in front of the crowd of modest customers of the place, that almost bumps into a pool player while walking.

Client 1: Hey! Watch it.

Client 2: Hey! (A other client from another table is playing the cards that came out of the winning hand with a truant laughter)

The foolish arrives at the table with two sailors loaders of merchandise coming from high seas in the background who received the two beers to discuss a closing deal.

Sailor man Sailor man: Well, I, uh, suppose that concludes out business, then.

Throws a small sack of coins at the foolish with glasses.

Foolish with glasses Foolish with glasses: (Stop drinking the beer to appreciate the payment) Mm. I suppose it does. (revisó a cantidad del dinero que esta en el saco cuando concluye lo siguiente) Wait... (a nervous chuckle comes out, until it stopped the devalued value of the same currency) Uh, wait a minute. This, uh... (chuckles as a twitch) uh, this... isn't what we agreed on, so...

Sailor man: Well, demand for your wares has dropped since we made our arrangements. This is the new value.

Foolish with glasses: Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We, um... we shook on it. (Chuckles) Ten thousand. (Tilts it on the table)

Sailor man: Such are the risks of business.

Foolish with glasses: Ten.

Sailor man: It's a fair price. (Grab your mug of beer) I think you should take it.

Foolish with glasses: No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. (Scoffing) I can't do that. I can't do that! (Annoyed, he tosses the open sack of money and it rolls off the table towards the sailor man, a coin stabbing the feline-eyes rough sailor girl feline-eyes rough sailor girl)

The feline-eyes rough sailor girl makes an intimidating stare at the foolish with glasses playing with her blade.

Feline-eyes sailor girl Feline-eyes sailor girl: Make your choice. (Leaves the knife on the table with the coins lying on it, the foolish with glasses gulps his throat)

Footsteps are heard approaching the table with a crowd talking in the background.

Muscular man Muscular man: (Off-camera) You folks need anything?

Sailor man: Leave us.

Muscular man: (Now the camera focuses on him) You sure about that? Sounded to me like--

Feline-eyes sailor girl: (Now the camera focuses to the two sailors) Piss off.

Muscular man reacted with an uneasy look.

Muscular man: Ah. (He leaves for a short time to look for an available chair to enter with the three clients, sweeping with a wooden squeak) I think I know what you need. (Placing the chair in front of the two sailors, he sits down with them)

Feline-eyes sailor girl: You don't seem to listen, barman--

Muscular man: A bit of advice. Don't threaten the guy who pours the drinks. (I pointed out to the other clients)

The music stops abruptly when the feline-eyes sailor girl observed the customers who left their leisure to see how annoyed they were to get angry with their bartender as a threatening sign based on their reputation of the place. Music in the background is resumed.

Sailor man: (Off-camera) So you're Vander Vander (The camera briefly focuses on the two sailors).

Vander takes out his pipe and lights it to smoke.

Feline-eyes sailor girl: Hound of the Underground. (The camera focuses on the two sailors) I expected something... younger.

Vander smokes his pipe. And exhales it.

Vander: We were expecting traders who would honor their word, so I guess we're all disappointed.

Sailor man: (Now the camera focuses on him) You got us all wrong, my friend. We were just... negotiating.

Vander: (Off-camera) Now you're speaking my language. (Now the camera focuses on him) How about you just give Huck Huck the rest of what you owe him, and I'll let you walk out of here in one piece? (Huck takes a sip of beer from his pitcher)

The sailor man made him nervous, while the feline-eyed sailor girl makes a skeptical look at her claim.

Vander: (Now the camera focuses on him) Do we, uh... have a deal? (He offers his pipe to the feline-eyes sailor girl)

Feline-eyes sailor girl: (She exhales, picks up Vander's pipe to smoke, but ends up coughing to inhale into her lungs) This is vile. (She returns the pipe to Vander)

Vander: (Now the camera focuses on him) You'll learn to love it.

Vander realizes that the 4 boys arrived at the bar that is their home below that business of theirs. Violet looked away from Vander in the crowd of customers knowing that he is her adopted father and the boys was caused a problem. Vander decides to leaves his consumers from the table with the following welcome message.

Vander: Welcome to the Lanes.

In the other scene, below the bar, in their respective room shared between the 4 boys with the lights on in the lamp on the table, Violet sits on the main couch exhausted and exhaled from the bad day, Claggor grunts from the beating hours ago and threw his glasses on the table, Mylo also grunts from the pain and settled in as he left his feet on the table, Powder hugs her own leg out of anguish to be in a fetal position.

Violet: Vander lears none of this.

Mylo: (With irony, off-camera) No worries there. Powder took care of the evidence.

Powder: I tried, okay? You don't get it. You're older, you're bigger. (Stammers) It, it isn.t fair.

Mylo: (He reacts in annoyance and raises his head) So stick with us! Take a punch or two.

Suddenly, the camera focuses on the entrance of the room to Vander who is looking at the 4 boys. There is laughter in the crowd in the distance from the place across the bar to the room itself. Violet, keep thinking about what to say to Vander without causing discomfort in the end. Also Powder, and the rest. The camera focuses on the overview of the 4 boys.

Vander: Everyone all right?

Mylo: Never better.

Vander: (The camera focuses on him, as he walked towards the 4 boys) Good. I don't suppose you can explain why it is that I'm hearing about an explosion and a foot chase topside? Four children fleeing the scene. (Vander stopped near Violet) What the hell wrere you thinking?

Violet: (The camera focuses on her) That we can handle a real job.

Vander: (The camera focuses on him closely) A real job?

Violet: (The camera focuses on both of them, she being well focused) We got our own tip, planned a route, nobody even saw.

Vander: (The camera focuses towards him) You blew up a building.

Violet: (Turns her head towards Vander) That wasn't...

Vander: Did you even stop to think about what could have happened to you? (Violet stops see Vander) Eh? To them? (Referring to the rest of the boys, which the camera focuses on in the same way as the rest of the boys)

Violet reflects on that day's actions and may have caused an unintended consequence of her actions. Vander sighs with an expression of desperation before continuing what he was saying.

Vander: Where did you even get this tip?

Powder answers Vander's question.

Powder: We just heard it at Benzo's Benzo's shop.

Vander: From?

Powder: (She looked at Vander sheepishly) Little Man. (Vander sighs heavily when Violet bursts in)

Violet: I took us there. If you wanna be mad, be mad at me. But you're the one who always says we have to earn our place in this world.

Vander: I also told you time and time again, the Northside's off-limits. (The camera focuses on him with an angry expression) We stay out of Piltover's business.

Violet: (The camera focuses on both) Why? They've got plenty, while we're down here scraping together coins. (Now the camera focuses on her) When did you get so comfortable living in someone else's shadow?

Vander paused, the rest of the guys felt a surprising thrill from Violet's rebelliousness with the argument that leaves Vander in a situation between authority and propriety, so he wants to put Violet on top of it.

Vander: Everyone out.

The boys obeyed and started to get up to leave the room. Powder is the last to leave to close the door.

Vander: Sit down.

Violet: I'm fine.

Vander: (Off-camera) Sit. Dowm. (Violet sighs and sits in the same chair she sat in earlier)

Vander sits at the table across from Violet, he exhales.

Vander: Those kids look uo to you.

Violet: (The camera focuses on her next to Vander from behind) Yeah, I know. (She sighs)

Vander: (The camera focuses on him) You know, but you don't know. When people look up to you, you don't get to be selfish.

Violet: (The camera focuses on her) I'm not--

Vander: You say run, they run. (The camera focuses on him) You saw swim, they dive in. (Pointing with his right hand) You say light a fire, they show up with oil. But whatever happens, it's on you.

Violet sighs under Vander's teaching that every action has a reaction.

Vander: (Off-camera) Just like it's on me what happens to us down here. (The camera focuses on him) We make ourselves a problem for Piltover, and they will send the enforcers.

Violet: (The camera focuses on her) So? Why answer to them? These are out streets. Someone should remind them of that.

Vander: (The camera focuses on him) You're not hearing me. That path?

Vander reaches up to grab Violet's fists which is stained with blood from Deckard's thugs.

Vander: This? (The camera focuses on him) It's not gonna solve your problems. (Violet's hand releases it) Just makes more of them. (The camera focuses on Violet looking at her dirty fists) We clear?

Vander pulls out his greenish glass bottle of alcohol by pulling the cap off the concho with his teeth and spits it out somewhere else, and soaks it a little with a white cloth. Vander exhales as he cleans and disinfects Violet's wounded face, which reacts with a groan of pain from the strong disinfectant liquid.

Vander: (Off-camera, except for his hand) How'd you get this? (Violet scoffs)

Violet: (The camera focuses on both) Some idiot was following us.

Vander: On our side? Who?

Violet: I don't know. He was after the stuff.

Vander: Where is it now? (Disinfect Violet's face again)

Violet: (Sighs) We lost it.

Vander: All of it? (Violet gestures up and down discreetly a 'yes') Good. (Leave the bottle on the table next to him, now the camera focuses on him) Nothing can tie you to what happened up there. You're gonna have to lay low for a bit, understand?

Violet: (The camera focuses on her with a short pause) Okay. (Now she looks at Vander) We're gonna be fine, right?

Vander: (The camera focuses on both, being him towards the front) I'll take care of it. (He stands up)

## Jayce

Jayce and Caitlyn Caitlyn arrive at the penthouse only to find it in the process of being robbed. Jayce attempts to force the door open, but the explosion triggered by the hex crystal knocks him unconscious.

Oh.
Uh, careful. That's your parents' money you're dropping.
Vi: Powder, we've gotta go!
Jayce: Hello? Is someone in there? Hey, open up!
Jayce? Jayce!

----------------

## Interlude?

We flash back to a scene from Jayce's childhood. He and his mother, Ximena Ximena, are stranded alone in the wilderness in the wake of a brutal blizzard. Ximena succumbs to the cold and collapses in the snow, prompting Jayce to cry out desperately for help. A hooded figure approaches and begins weaving a fantastical arcane spell. Soon, the blizzard disappears, and flowers bloom as though it had never been snowing. Ximena begins to regain her strength. Jayce is baffled by the mage's power as the hooded figure leaves him with a now-depleted hex crystal inscribed with a magical rune.

Jayce: Mom! Mom. Mom, wake up. Mom. Help! Please, someone, help us! Help! Please! No. Wait. Wait.

----------------

## Jayce

Returning to the present day, enforcers are searching through the remains of Jayce's half-destroyed penthouse. Grayson and Viktor question Jayce regarding the myriad of dangerous and illegal items found throughout the premises. Viktor explains that he is the assistant of Heimerdinger Heimerdinger, dean of the Academy and head of the Council, and that he was sent to ensure that anything dangerous is removed safely, including Jayce himself.

\[
Viktor: You really went to the undercity to get these? Weren't you afraid? A little danger is worth the risk, don't you think?
]? discontinuit?

Viktor: How? Let's go over it again.

Jayce: You have to believe me. I didn't do this.

Viktor: Relax, kid. We know it was a break-in but that doesn't explain this. There's a lot of restricted items here and I don't see any permits. You wanna tell me how you got them?

Jayce: Hey, hey! Be careful with that, please.

Viktor?: I believe someone should have said that earlier.
Viktor: What happened here?

Jayce: Science, I guess?

Viktor: Last time I checked, science didn't require illegal equipment. Nor was this approved by the Academy. Who authorized your research?

Jayce: It was an independent study. Who are you anyway?

Viktor: I'm assistant to the Dean of the Academy, who it may serve you to remember is also head of the Council. He sent me here to ensure that anything dangerous is removed safely. Which, according to my list, includes you.

Jayce: What? How am I dangerous?

Viktor: Uh, that's for the council to decide.

## Perhaps space for the flashback here?

----------------

## Jayce

Jayce is incarcerated in a Piltover jail, where Heimerdinger visits his cell and inquires into the nature of his research.

Heimerdinger: Imprisonment. What a curious principle. We confine the physical body, yet the mind is still free. I do love a good conundrum. I remember the first time I saw you at the Academy. You reminded me of myself. A scientist ready to forge a new vector of experimentation. But sometimes we venture too far. No great science should ever put lives in danger. Be honest, now.
What manner of inquiry was this?

Jayce: Professor Heimerdinger, I believe I've discovered something truly incredible. A way to harness magic through science.

Heimerdinger: Magic?

Jayce: Yes.

Heimerdinger: No.

Jayce: No?

Heimerdinger: The Arcane is dangerous, Jayce.
?: A force of nature.
Heimerdinger: Science cannot control it.

Jayce: But maybe it can. I'm close to a breakthrough, I know it.

Heimerdinger: How old are you, my boy?

Jayce: I'm... I'm 24.

Heimerdinger: Ah. Well, I am now 307 years old. All my life, I've pursued the mysteries of science, only to discover some are better left unsolved. This, I'm afraid, is one of them. Own your mistakes before the Council, admit your work was dangerous, but speak nothing of magic. Do that and I theorize you'll get away with, um, how do you say, a slap on the wrist.

----------------

## Claggor?

Vi, Powder, Mylo, and Claggor take up residence in what appears to be an abandoned arcade, marking it as an ideal spot to "lay low" since enforcers "never" come down there. However, Marcus Marcus and a team of enforcers arrive just outside and begin questioning locals about the children. One man spits on Marcus's shoe, prompting the enforcers to violently throw him through the stained glass wall of the arcade. When Marcus sees the children within, he orders them searched. Mylo taunts the enforcers, claiming that their search will be fruitless, but Powder anxiously clutches the pouch of hex crystals at her side, attracting the attention of Marcus. Claggor flips the light switch, darkening the arcade as the children begin their escape. After a brief altercation, they flee out the back door, only to find themselves surrounded in the alley. Luckily, Ekko Ekko appears, offering a ladder leading up into a dark passageway. The kids kick down the ladder behind them, with Vi and Powder agreeing that they need to hide the crystals.

Remind me why we bother with this dump.
Vander said to lay low.
Enforcers never come down here, so this is as good a place as any.
Oh, what's the matter, Mylo? You worried Powder's gonna beat you again? Hey, if she didn't keep fixing these things, I wouldn't keep missing.
You guys know I wouldn't take you on a job you couldn't handle, right? Are you kidding? That was the best job we've ever done.
Maybe just don't take Powder next time.
Umâ¦ -Get back.
- Tell me where I can find them.
- Topsider business ain't my concern.
It's every one of you trencher's concern now.
Give me a name.
-Hey, guys? You should see this Search them.
Go ahead, idiots.
We've got nothing.
Go! Go! -Come on! Get them! Over here! - You need to hide those crystals.
- Yeah, no shit.

----------------

## Mel

Councilor Mel Medarda pores over various handheld puzzle boxes presented by a craftsman, intending to present one to Councilor Hoskel for his birthday.

The House Ferros received your letter.
They insist business is steady.
Steady is stagnant, Elora.
They wished me to remind you that it's thanks to their innovations that you are the richest person in Piltover.
Yet I remain the poorest Medarda.
Excellent choice, Councilor Medarda.
Supreme challenge.
- If I may - We need something revolutionary, Elora.
Something to put Piltover on the map.
- What of today's trial? - His name is Jayce of House Talis.
A House? Remind me.
They're toolmakers.
I believe they came to renown for their design of the... -collapsible pocket wrench.
- But Heimerdinger favors him? - As far as I can tell.
Hmm.
This one.
But that's... Well, that's a child's toy.
Good.

----------------

## Cassandra

Caitlyn and her parents, Mr. Tobias Kiramman and Mrs. Cassandra Kiramman, discuss their responsibility to defend Jayce in his time of need, as they are his patrons and have sponsored his work thus far.

The boy's got ambition.
It's why we supported him in the first place.
Ambition? Darling, he nearly blew up our daughter.
Jayce had nothing to do with that.
He was robbed.
- We need to help him.
- Caitlyn's right.
We've known Jayce for years.
Besides, we're his patrons.
If anyone is meant to speak up for him, it's us.

----------------

## Vander

At The Last Drop, an impromptu community meeting has begun. A woman named Sevika argues that Zaun should fight back against the enforcers

We should hit them back.
We've got the numbers to beat them.
Yeah.
Let's teach them what it means to mess with us.
Yeah! - You sure that's what you want? - Let's do it.
We crossed that bridge once before, and we all know how that ended.
You're just protecting your kids.
I'm protecting our people.
I'd do the same for any one of you.
We look out for each other.
It's the way it's always been.
This will blow over.
We just need to stand together.
The Vander I knew, the one who built the underground, wouldn't be afraid to fight.
- Do I look afraid? - No.
You look weak.
Why isn't he doing anything? We kicked the Enforcers' butts with just the four of us.
Imagine what the whole of the Lanes could do.
- Jeez, even Powder wants to fight.
- So, why aren't we? Spill it, Ekko.
Um... Oh, okay.
Well, um, Vander's got a deal with the Enforcers.
What deal? 

----------------

## Mel

The seven councilors (Councilors Medarda, Heimerdinger, Kiramman, Hoskel, Shoola, Salo, and Bolbok) convene within the Council chambers in preparation of Jayce's trial. As a birthday gift, Mel presents her puzzle box to Hoskel.

For your birthday, Councilor.
Ah, Mel, this is too kind.
I'm told it was built only for the sharpest of minds.
And I bought you some Ginko nuts.
Don't you know I'm allergic? What are you trying to do? -Kill an old man? Jayce Talis.

Grayson arrives with Jayce in tow and the trial begins. Mrs. Kiramman reads the charges against him: illegal experimentation and endangering the citizens of Piltover. Jayce admits that his work was dangerous, asking for the Council's forgiveness and permission to continue his studies. In the ensuing discussion, the Council hammers him with questions and judgments until he can bear no more and admits his true purpose: trying to create magic. The Council is dumbfounded, but Jayce pleads his case: he believes magic can be created and controlled through science. However, Heimerdinger opines on the horrors that arcane power has bore throughout his lifetime. Bolbok states that the Ethos is clear: Jayce must be banished from Piltover.

You are accused of illegal experimentation and endangering the citizens of Piltover.
What do you have to say for yourself? The materials were far more dangerous than I was aware of, and Iâ¦ I now know my actions were against Academy regulations.
What I did endangered people.
It was reckless, and for that, I'm sorry.
I ask the Council's forgiveness, and I hope that I can continue my studies.
As Jayce's patron of many years, I can speak for his character.
I believe that one day, he will be a great contributor to our society.
He destroyed a building.
Is this the sort of contribution we can expect? If you were a scientist, you'd know you can't make a prototype without breaking a few wrenches.
Do you have anything to show for your work besides an explosion? Uh, no.
It came to nothing.
So, you're saying your study was meaningless? - It was revolutionary! - Revolutionary how? All I see is a boy meddling with things he doesn't understand.
The Academy seems to have loosened its standards.
This is a fine line.
If we condone this, what's next? Ridiculous, really.
The Council has more important matters to deal with.
Perhaps we should just finish thisâ¦ I was trying to create magic.
Magic? Arcane talents are something you're born with.
They can't be fabricated.
Actually, I believe it is possible.
Has anyone even tried it before? The Arcane is the curse of our world.
My race was nearly destroyed by it.
Surely, we, the pioneers of science, can use it for good.
We're the champions of discovery.
Why fear it when we can master it? Jayce, enough.
This is the city of progress, think of the wonders we could create.
- Let me prove - Enough! You don't understand what's at stake.
But how can you? That's a burden that only I here carry.
Time.
I've seen this power in the wrong hands.
It corrupts, consumes, lays waste to civilizations.
That cannot happen here, my boy.
It must not.
Heimerdinger is right.
Piltover was founded to escape the warmongering of mages, -not cultivate it.
The Ethos is clear.
He must be banished from Piltover.
Please, let me speak!

Ximena comes forward from the audience. She claims that Jayce is not in his right mind and pleads with the Council to let her son come home. Heimerdinger moves that Jayce be expelled from the Academy and remanded to the care of his parents in place of banishment. Councilors Kiramman, Medarda, and Hoskel also vote in favor of the sentence, and thus the motion passes with a 4-3 majority.

As a lower house, my voice doesn't carry much weight here.
But as a mother, I have a voice that matters deeply.
My son isn't in his right mind.
His entire life, he's chased an impossible dream.
What he did was, uh, foolish and unwise.
But he has a good heart.
Please, let him come home.
A crime like this can't be overlooked.
The boy must be punished.
A violation of the Ethos calls for banishment, but I can sympathize with a young man's dream to change the world.
Perhaps in this matter, a lesser sentence may suffice.
I move that Jayce be summarily expelled from the Academy and remanded to the care of his parents.
All those in favor? You may take your son home, Mrs.
Talis, but he is to never set foot on Academy grounds again.

----------------

## Marcus

Silco orchestrates a meeting with Marcus. Though Marcus is suspicious of the stranger, Silco implies that he can help him find who he's looking for.

First time I've been invited to the Lanes.
It better be worth my time.
Ah, you see, that's your weakness, Marcus.
You carry your chin so high, you fail to see the opportunity below.
Who are you? You're looking for four children, the ones running circles around Piltover's finest.
What about it? Don't look so concerned.
I'm about to make your day.

----------------

## Jayce

Ximena laments to Jayce that if she had not spoken, he would have been banished.

-Can I come in? Hmm.
I still remember the look on your face when you found these.
Jayce, please.
If I hadn't spoken, you'd be lost to me.
I had to say something.
Magic saved your life.
Yes, but it won't save yours now.
You need to let it go.
I could've convinced the Council.
If my own family won't help me, I'll find someone who will.

----------------

## Viktor

Viktor helps Heimerdinger consolidate Jayce's research with the intent to destroy it, but he expresses fascination with Jayce's findings. 

Oh.
That foolish boy.
Yeah, I must admit, his theory intrigues.
If dangerous ideas didn't excite the imagination, we would never wander astray.
Could it work? Could these stones really invoke magic? Nonsense.
It's far too unstable.
Could you stabilize it? Me? Why would I? That only leads to more problems, and that poor boy has enough of them already.
There.
Come tomorrow morning, his research will be safely disposed of.
Lock up.
No, no, no.
Magic is far too dangerous in the wrong hands.

Heimerdinger leaves Viktor to lock up, which only allows him to examine Jayce's work in greater detail.

----------------

## Silco

Silco offers Deckard a vial of shimmer.

Will he live? Long enough.
Beautiful, aren't they? Yet, up there on the surface, no one even knows they exist.
They're monsters.
There's a monster inside all of us.
What? No.
No, no! It'll kill me! I'd like to let you in on a very important secret I learned when I was about your age, boy.
You see, power, real power doesn't come to those who were born strongest, or fastest, or smartest.
No.
It comes to those who will do anything to achieve it.
-It's time to let the monster out.

 At last, Deckard drinks the vial and undergoes a vast physical transformation, growing in size and strength, eyes and veins an unnatural purple. He shrieks in pain, overwhelmed.

----------------

## Caitlyn

Jayce visits the Kiramman estate, where he encounters Caitlyn through the front gate.

They won't see you.
Your name's no good now.
My dad says you're a misfit, and that we can't be friends anymore.
So, why are you out here? I'm a misfit too, I suppose.
What will you do? Join the Talis hammer business, I guess.
You can't do that.
No, I can't.
Come inside, Caitlyn.
Now.
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to explain...
I think you've done enough.

----------------

## Grayson

Grayson and Marcus meet with the Council to update them on their progress with the investigation of the explosion.

You said this was a robbery.
- Did they take anything dangerous? - Hard to say.
We don't exactly know what we did find, let alone what we didn't.
This mention of magic has the people afraid.
The culprits must be apprehended.
We're doing our best, Councilor.
I assure you.
Your attitude makes me question if your best is up to the task.
Oh, we'll find them.
Don't worry.
We've conducted exhaustive interrogations, frozen commerce for half the district.
With all due respect, Councilor, don't you think we've pushed them hard enough? Do whatever it takes.
Turn the undercity upside down if you have to.
Just find them!

----------------

## Marcus

Marcus brings a pair of enforcers into The Last Drop, confronting Vander and urging him to give up his children. He commands one officer to search the place. Vander reaches under the counter to get Marcus a drink, discreetly pressing a red button while he's at it. The button triggers a cymbal-banging monkey toy in the lower room, alerting the children to the presence of danger. When the enforcer enters the room, they find it dark and seemingly empty. Vi, Powder, Mylo, Claggor and Ekko hide in the rafters above while the enforcer searches the room, though Powder struggles to keep her grip and very nearly loses it. She finally falls from the ceiling just as soon as the officer closes the door and leaves. They report back to Marcus, having found nothing. Enraged, Marcus threatens Vander and everyone in the bar, shattering his drink with a police baton before leaving. Vander goes to check on the kids and Vi angrily insists that the enforcers won't stop coming and that they need to fight back.

Welcome to The Last Drop.
- What can I get you? - Four sump-rats will do.
Search the place.
While you're wasting your time, how about a proper drink? I'll take the strongest shit you got.
Mm.
You be careful with that.
Nearly forgot.
I ran into an old friend of yours.
He had some stories.
You weren't always the peacekeeper, were you? Yeah, well, you can't escape the past.
Right? Be a shame if I had to put them on again.
Cast iron's, well, it's hard to clean.
You people down here are all the same, mistaking arrogance for bravery.
You think you're standing up for something, but we all know there is a crime behind every coin that passes through this place.
You're just a small man in a little hole the world forgot to bury.
And I'm gonna bury the lot of you.

----------------

## Vi ?

-Are you all okay? No, we're not okay.
They almost saw Powder.
- What if they took her? - No one is taking any of you.
- Never let that happen.
- It's already happening.
You heard him, they won't stop.
We need to fight back.
And if you won't, I will.
I've heard this kind of talk before.

----------------

## Vander ?

Vander brings Vi to the Bridge of Progress, where her parents died. Vi continues to assert that she's willing to fight for change and that she wants a better life for Powder. Vander stresses that he felt the same way once, but that if he hadn't started a war, her parents would still be alive. He admits that he doesn't know what to do, but that he'll figure something out.

Why are we here? You still don't understand.
What I don't understand is how you can work with them.
We were here.
We saw what they did.
I grew up knowing I'm less than them, that my place is down there.
I want Powder to have more than that, and I'm willing to fight for it.
So was I.
I was angry, just like you.
I led us across this bridge, thinking things could change.
If I hadn'tâ¦ your parents would still be alive.
I know you wanna hurt the topsiders for what they've done to us.
But who are you willing to lose? Mylo? Claggor? Powder? Nobody wins in war, Vi.
What are we gonna do? The Enforcers will come back.
Iâ¦ I don't know.
I'll, uh, I'll figure it out.

----------------

## Jayce

Jayce returns to the wreckage of his study. He gazes from the gaping hole in the wall onto the streets below and contemplates throwing himself from the edge. Viktor interrupts.


Am I interrupting? The hell's your problem? What's that? Another list with my name on it? Actually, yes, but only because you signed your notes.
Every page, I might add.
Eh, a little egotistical, don't you think? Is that why you came? To insult me? No, no, I wasâ¦ I was intrigued by what you said at the trial.
That makes you the only one.
Yes, well, I wanted to talk about your work.
This Hextech theory of yours.
It's not a theory.
I saw with my own eyes what magic can do, the lives it could save.
You've no idea how beautiful it is.
And now it's gone.
No one believed me.
Nobody's ever believed in me.
A poor cripple from the undercity.
I was an outsider the moment I stepped foot in Piltover.
I didn't have the benefits of a patron or a name.
I simply believed in myself.
Which is why I'm here because I think you're on to something.
I want to help you complete your research.
No one thinks it can be done.
When you're going to change the world, don't ask for permission.
I don't even know your name.
It's Viktor.

----------------

## Vi

Vi returns to The Last Drop and finds Powder working on smoke bombs and nail grenades for the enforcers, confident that her creations will work this time. Vi gives her the stuffed rabbit, apparently having retrieved it from the power line.

- Vi, where you been? - Rumor is the Lanes are gonna fight.
Look, I made them for the Enforcers.
These are smoke bombs, and those two are full of nails.
They're gonna work this time, I know it.
Me too.
You know, Powder, what makes you different makes you strong.
Always remember that, okay?

----------------

## Grayson

Grayson reprimands Marcus

What the hell were you thinking, going into The Last Drop? - Do you have any idea what you've done? - I was getting results! - You heard the Council.
- You're a fool.
There is no stopping what happens now.
Maybe it's not too late.

----------------

## Vander

Powder takes the stuffed rabbit to the bar, where Vander pours her a drink. He sees the toy and silently comes to the realization that Vi is attempting to give herself up to the enforcers.

----------------

## Marcus?

Led by Grayson, enforcers march down the streets of Zaun. 

----------------

## Silco

Silco recalls a story of when Vander tried to kill him via drowning: the incident which led to his deformed eye. He reflects on how it changed his perspective, and contemplates his gratitude towards Vander for doing it.

Ever wonder what it's like to drown? Story of opposites.
There's peace in water.
Like it's holdin' you, whisperin' in low tones to let it in.
And every problem in the world will fade away.
-But then there's this thingâ¦ â¦in your head, and it's raging.
Lighting every nerve with madness.
-To fight.
-To survive.
And all the while, this question lingers before you: "Have you had enough?" It's funny.
You could pass a lifetime without ever facing a choice like that.
But it changes you forever.
For that, I thank youâ¦ old friend.

----------------

## Vi

Vi breaks into and sits alone in Benzo's shop, waiting for the enforcers to arrive. She hears footsteps outside, the door opens, and her eyes widen in surprise. Vander and Benzo Benzo arrive at the pawn shop to find Vi Vi sitting alone and waiting for the enforcers to take her. Vander shoves her into the back room and locks the door, where she begins banging and screaming to be let out.

Vander? We don't have much time.
How did you find me? I'm proud of you.
Always have been.
I'm sorry, Iâ¦ This is the only way to protect the others.
-Vander.
You've got a good heart.
Don't ever lose it.
No matter how the world tries to break you.
Protect the family.
What are you No.
-Vander.
-Let me out.
This isn't right.
I'm guessing that's for me.

----------------

## Marcus

Grayson and Marcus arrive moments later, waiting for Vander's response. In Vi's place, Vander offers himself up to be arrested. Grayson argues that she needs Vander to remain and keep the peace, or else "it all falls apart." He retorts that Benzo will handle things, saying that "it's the only way." Marcus handcuffs Vander while Vi continues her protests. Vi hears undue commotion and tries to look out a small window. Marcus shouts for someone to stop, and a sudden splatter of blood obscures Vi's vision. Grayson and several other enforcers lie dead on the ground, killed by a shimmer-crazed Deckard. The monster disappears as quickly as it had arrived, leaving Marcus, Vander, and Benzo confused and on high alert. Finally, Silco reveals himself and Benzo steps forward to attack him, but Deckard emerges once again to kill Benzo with inhuman strength and speed. Marcus is stunned, shouting that "this wasn't the deal." Silco dismissively replies that the deal has changed and tosses Marcus a sack of coins. Deckard knocks Vander unconscious with a punch to the face and drags him away, following Silco, leaving both Marcus and Vi to stew in distress alone.

You gonna let us make the arrest or not?
You'll oblige a doomed man one last smoke, won't you?
I'm not putting you away, Vander.
The Council needs its pound of flesh.
Without you down here, it all falls apart.
Benzo will handle things.
I may not have my devilish charm, but he runs a tight ship.
Vander, no.
You can't do this.
You won't be coming back for a long time.
-I know.
- Why? - Mm.
-It's the only way.
-Benzo, open the damn door.
What's happening? Hey.
Stop right there! What the devil...
No.
Silco? You animal.
Go crawl back into whatever hole you came out of.
Benzo, stay back.
You never did know when to walk away.
-Wait.
No! Hmm.
Stubborn to the end.
What the hell have you done? This wasn't the deal! Deal's changed.

----------------

## Jayce

Jayce and Viktor are deep in study and arrive at a calculation that could stabilize the hex crystals.

No.
No! This entire time, I thought I needed to dampen the oscillations.
The crystals will only stabilize at high frequency.
- You have to - Crank it.
Yes.
Yes.
You have toâ¦ crank it.
- It works.
- Ehâ¦ On paper.
Well, we could test it if we had access to my equipment.
Which is being destroyed tomorrow.
- What? - Oh.
Iâ¦ Yeah.
I, I meant to tell you.
That research is everything.
Myâ¦ my whole life.
Maybe if we showed them the equations, - they'd let us - We need more than promises.
We need proof.
Not without the crystals.
The enforcers took them all.
They're gone.
Yeah.
Locked away in Heimerdinger's lab.
No. No. No.
You heard the Council.
If we're wrongâ¦ Better be right then.
Why? Why would you risk this? Do you think it was my life's ambition to be an assistant? Scientists seek discoveries.
Ways to make the world a better place.
This Hextech dream of yours has the potential to do that.
Our Hextech dream.

----------------

## Vi

Ekko arrives to free Vi from the pawn shop.

Ekko: I saw everything.

Both in tears, they embrace, and Vi asks where they took Vander.

Be... Benzo.
They... What about Vander?
Ekko: They took him.
Vi: Where?

----------------

## Vi

The effects of shimmer wear off on Deckard, returning him to a normal yet nauseous state. Vander begins to wake up as a thug drags him across a catwalk overlooking a workshop where Silco's workers are forging metal weapons and mass-producing shimmer. 

It's a little crude, I'll admit.
The base violence necessary for change.
But we both know topside won't listen to anything else.
Even with your monsters, you won't win a war against Piltover.
I don't have to.
I just need to scare them.
They won't dare set foot in the underground again.
You'll get people killed.
For what? Pride? For respect.
Opportunity.
Everything they've denied us.
You had my respect.
The Lanes' respect, but thatâ¦ that was never enough for you.
We shared a vision, Vander.
A dream of freedom.
Not just for the Lanes, but the whole of the underground, united as one.
The nation of Zaun.
Do you even remember? I trusted you.
And you betrayed me.
What I did to youâ¦ I've never forgiven myself.
You were my brother.
No, you still don't understand.
Can you imagine what it's like? When your blood mixes with the filth and the river toxins eat through your nerves.
Oh, I hated you for what you'd done.
But as time passed, so did my hate.
And I was left with an understanding.
The only way to defeat a superior enemy is to stop at nothing.
To become what they fear.
I hated you, but you kept my respect.
Until you made peace with them.
Played lapdog after everything we suffered.
I had no choice.
Perhaps.But now you do.
Shimmer.
We have the power.
We can finally realize our dream, brother.
Look at what you've done.
Benzo.
These kids.
In fighting topside, you'd sacrifice everything that we are.
It's not the way.
Can't you see that? Kill me if you have to, but please spare the Lanes.
You'd die for the cause, but you won't fight for one? I'm just... not that man anymore.
I'll show you what you really are.

In the end, Silco's thug takes Vander to be locked away, but before he goes, Vander sees that Sevika is here under Silco's employ.

----------------

## Jayce

In the black of night, Viktor and Jayce arrive at Heimerdinger's lab. Viktor begins unlocking the door when a flashlight ignites on them, wielded by Mel, who seems impressed at the mens' "conviction." They scramble to convince Mel of hextech's potential while a security guard is heard approaching. Mel relents, telling them that they have one night to impress her or to expect exile. She then moves to engage the guard in conversation and steer him away from Heimerdinger's lab. Finally, Viktor unlocks the door.

Hmm.
So far, so good.
Hmm.
Willing to risk exile for your endeavor.
That's quite the conviction.
Councilor.
- What a surprise to see you, huh? - Wait a minute, this isn't my bedroom.
How could I haveâ¦ Please.
We can prove that it works.
Hmm.
You couldn't do so earlier today, how is tonight any different? We figured out how to stabilize it.
You're the Professor's assistant.
No, he's my new partner.
Even if you manage to prove your theory, the Council would destroy it.
Heimerdinger will recognize the potential.
He already does.
It scares him.
It scares them all.
What about you? I recognize that any worthwhile venture involves risk.
Councilor, this technology, it's real.
And no matter what happens here, it's going to change our world.
We should be the ones to lead it.
Piltover, the land of progress, equality, innovation.
I know it sounds impossible, but when have we ever let that stop us? Please, just give us a chance.
One night, gentlemen.
Impress me, or I'd suggest you pack your bags.
-Harold.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, Councilor Medarda, youâ¦ you nearly scared me to death.
Ah.
Another late night.
The work just doesn't end.
Well, I suppose that's a sign of good business, huh?

----------------

## Vi

At The Last Drop, Mylo and Claggor are ready to fight the enforcers while Powder Powder is on her bed with the stuffed rabbit, depressed. Vi then returns and explains to her siblings that Benzo is dead and Vander has been kidnapped, describing the horror of the monster she saw. She resolves to help Vander, revealing that Ekko followed Silco to his workshop. As the kids get ready to join her in saving Vander, Vi tells Powder that she can't come along because it's too dangerous. Powder argues, but Vi is adamant, telling her she isn't ready. She gives Powder a flare, instructing her to run if someone comes for her, and wherever she lights it, Vi will find her. Then, she departs along with Mylo and Claggor.

Well, if the enforcers hit tonight, we'll be readyâ¦ - I think.
- Dibs on the bat.
- No, no, no, no.
I found it.
- But I called it.
- But I found it.
- Respect the dibs.
- I called it already.
- Respect theâ¦ -Stop being such a big baby.
Vi? - Where's the - Oh, you're back.
Hey.
Those are Vander's.
Slow down.
What's going on? - Benzo's dead.
- Dead? - They took Vander.
- Who took Vander? I don't know.
But I need to help him.
We're going with you.
Whatever killed Benzoâ¦ was like nothing I've ever seen.
It tore him apart.
You're not doing this alone, Vi.
He's our father too.
Do we know where they took him? Ekko followed them.
The old cannery next to the docks.
He saidâ¦ I need you to sit this one out, Powder.
What? - You're not coming.
- I'm not afraid.
It's too dangerous.
But families stick together.
You said it yourself.
- I know what I saidâ¦ - I want to fight.
I can help.
You're not ready.
You're all I have left.
I can't lose you.
Here.
If they come for you, take this and run.
Where ever you are, light it up, and I'll find you.
I promise.

----------------

## Jayce

Jayce prepares the machine that will activate the hex crystal. As it whirs to life, he expresses doubts that it will hold, but Viktor assures him that it will stabilize. The crystal emanates a blue glow, bright enough to become visible to the enforcers on the streets below.

It's all here.
It's time to crank it.
Are you sure you know what you're doing? I don't think it's gonna hold! Look at the buildup! The resonance will stabilize it.
Trust me.
Hey, you seeing this?

----------------

## Powder

Powder suffers a mental breakdown, screaming and sobbing in pain and rage, and throwing a cymbal-banging monkey toy at the wall and breaking it. She throws a bag to the ground, and several hex crystals roll out. Gradually, she begins to calm down as she realizes that one of them was responsible for the explosion at Jayce's apartment and comes up with a plan to help her family.

Powder: I can help them.

----------------

## Vi

Vi, Mylo, and Claggor stealthily scale the side of Silco's workshop and drop inside through a broken ceiling window.

Vi: Let's get Vander and get out.

----------------

## Jayce

Back in Heimerdinger's lab, The crystal stabilizes and begins to levitate a small distance from its casing, which Jayce remarks it's never done before. He turns a dial, causing several metal panels inscribed with runes to begin rotating on the machine. The crystal levitates higher and higher until suddenly, it releases a pulse of force powerful enough to make Jayce and Viktor put their arms up to shield themselves. The outward force continues, and Viktor shouts for Jayce to disengage, but Jayce struggles to reach for the switch under the intensity of the magical aura. Another pulse shatters the laboratory's windows, glass exploding outward, but then pulls the glass back in. Shards fly towards the two men, one cutting Jayce's cheek as he finally deactivates the machine.

I told you it would work.
All yours.
Wow.
It's never done that before.
All right.
Here we go.
Disengage! Incredible.

----------------

## Vi

Vi, Mylo, and Claggor sneak across the catwalk and come to a small room where Vander is locked to a chair via padlocks and metal restraints on all four limbs. Mylo begins picking the locks and Vander asks how they managed to get in with so many guards everywhere. Vi explains how easy it was, and they both realize that they've walked into a trap. Silco appears, welcoming them from the other side of the catwalk with a large group of henchmen at his back. Vi instructs Claggor to find another way out as she straps on Vander's metal gauntlets. Against Vander's wishes, she intends to fight Silco's henchmen.

-Vi.
What are you doing here? We're breakin' you out.
- Mylo.
- On it.
-How... how did you get in? There's guards everywhere.
It was easy.
We found an open window and... Oh, god.
You have to get out. Now.
Welcome.
You have my congratulations.
But I'm afraid this will be a very short reunion.
Hmm.
Have you heard the rumor? Vander the coward fled town with his children.
And they were never seen again.
Claggor, see if you can find another way out of here.
Okay.
You don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.
Vi.
Mylo.
Take a breath.
You can do this.
We're gonna get you out.
Ready to rise to the surface? Mylo, hurry.
Vi.
Silco.
Let her go.
This is between you and me.
You had your chance.
-Vi.
You did good.
- Open up.
- Stop this lunacy at once.
- They're almost through.
No pressure.
- Open the door.
That sounds like pressure! Open it.

----------------

## Powder

Powder arrives outside the workshop. Peering through a crevice, she sees Vi hold up her fists as the first of Silco's henchmen approaches her. Powder continues to climb up on an outside wall. The man strikes out at Vi with a knife, but she blocks and retaliates with an uppercut to the jaw that puts him on his back. The other henchmen begin to swarm towards Vi, but she deftly defeats several of them in succession. Mylo cracks the first lock, freeing Vander's leg. Claggor discovers that one of the walls leading outside is structurally weak.

Powder stops at a ledge where she's level with the catwalk and can see into the workshop through a hole in the wall. After seeing Vi knock out numerous henchmen, Sevika moves to join the fray, but Silco stops her. He retrieves a vial of shimmer and gives it to Deckard who drinks it down greedily. Once again, he transforms into a hulking monstrosity. Barely able to control himself, he throws another henchman off the catwalk with impossible ease. Vander urges Mylo to hurry.

For a moment, Deckard looks dazed. Vi takes the opportunity to go in for a forceful blow with both gauntlets, but Deckard grabs her by the neck with superhuman speed. Vander pleads with Silco to spare Vi but Silco rebuffs. Deckard throws Vi to the ground, knocking off one of the gauntlets. She crawls back to the room with Vander, slides the metal door shut, and locks it in place.

----------------

## Heimerdinger

Two enforcers, backed by Heimerdinger, attempt to force open the doors to the professor's lab, but Viktor has barred them together with his cane. With no time left to spare, Jayce closes his eyes and recalls the motions of the mage who saved his mother, dialing the switch accordingly. Several runes lock in place as one final, massive pulse of energy lifts Viktor and Jayce from the floor.

Viktor's cane snaps in two as the enforcers bash the doors open. Heimerdinger and the officers enter the lab to see a dazzling display of soft blue light filling the space. Jayce, Viktor, and numerous objects are suspended in midair as if floating in water.

Excuse me.
Underfoot.
You've actually done it.
But just because it can be done, doesn't mean... Will you please stop hovering? I'm not sure how to do that, sir.
This is not what Piltover's future looks like, my dear boys.

Mel appears in the doorway.

Mel: That's for the Council to decide.
Perhaps it's time.
For the era of magic.
Uh, Hextech.
For the era of Hextech.

----------------

## Powder

Powder shovels multiple hex crystals into the body of the cymbal-banging monkey toy, while Deckard is beginning to make dents in the door to Vander's prison.

Powder: You have to work. For me. Okay?

Claggor is slowly dismantling the weak wall with a metal pipe, and looses a single brick, giving him a tiny window outside. Powder winds up the monkey toy, reaches through a hole in the wall to set it in place. It walks toward Deckard, steadily clapping a crystal between its cymbals. Deckard notices the toy and pauses to examine it, befuddled. Mylo cracks the final lock to release Vander, and Claggor pushes away bricks until there's a human-sized hole in the wall.

One final time, the monkey claps, and the gem explodes.

Powder is knocked from her ledge. Sevika rushes to push Silco out of the way and gets caught in the explosion, losing her left arm. A flammable trail of shimmer residue ignites all the way back to Singed Singed's lab, consuming him in flames. One of the crystals ricochets into the ceiling of the Vander's cell, propelling metal shrapnel into Mylo and Claggor's bodies and burying them under debris as the roof collapses on top of them. As Powder is falling, she is in awe of the explosion. Marcus sees the explosion in the distance.

Vander is trapped under debris, but alive. Deckard gets back on his feet, merely stunned, and Silco orders his remaining henchmen to kill Vi and Vander. Vi is sobbing, crushed beneath the collapsed metal door. Vander summons all of his strength and pushes the debris off of himself, quickly knocking a henchman senseless as he approaches. He retrieves two metal hooks and dons them as improvised brass knuckles, dispatching a second henchman easily and makes his way to Deckard. Vi continues to sob upon seeing Mylo and Claggor dead. The head of the monkey toy lays at their feet. While Deckard's strength is immense, Vander holds his own until Silco stabs him with a dagger from behind. Vander whips around and takes Silco by the neck, but Silco stabs him again and his strength fails him. He goes limp, and Silco gently pushes him off the catwalk. Vander crashes on top of a crate full of shimmer vials, barely able to move. Silco orders Deckard to find Vi as Vander weakly reaches for a vial of shimmer.

Deckard easily lifts the metal door off of Vi and tosses it aside. However, Vander reappears, now transformed by shimmer and much larger than Deckard. He grabs the boy and pins him to the wall by the throat, squeezing until his body goes limp, and discarding him to the side. He then screams out Silco's name, but the flames engulfing the building are reaching dangerously close to Vi. Rather than pursue Silco, he swiftly grapples Vi and crashes through the wall with her, plummeting to the ground below.

Kill them.
I knew you still had it in you.
Find the girl.
Silco!

Vi holds Vander's head in her hands. 

Vi: Vander. Vander...

Vander: Take care of Powder.

Vi (shrieks in anguish): No!

Powder: Vi, it worked.

Vi: What?

Powder: Did you see me? My monkey bomb finally worked.

Vi: You did this?

Powder sees Vander's body and Claggor's bloodstained goggles on the ground, and slowly realizes what happened.

Vi: Why? Why did you do this? 

Powder: I didn't...

Powder begins crying

Powder: I was saving you. I only wanted to help. I only wanted to help. I only wanted to help. I only wanted to

Vi: I told you to stay away.

Powder: Please. Please. Please!

Vi: I told you to stay away!

Powder: No.

Vi slaps Powder across the face.

Powder: Why did you leave me?

Vi: Because you're a jinx. Do you hear me? Mylo was right.

Powder unravels into tears and fragmented begging. Realizing that she's gone too far with Powder, Vi walks away to burn off her anger.

No.
No.
No.
No.
Violet, please.
Violet, please.
Vi! Vi, come back! Please come back! Please, Violet.
I need you.
Please.
Violet... Violet.
Please.

Vi collapses against a wall in exhaustion.

----------------

## Vi

Believing Vi abandoned her, Powder goes into another mental breakdown, sobbing. Silco turns a corner and finds Powder. When Vi sees Silco standing over her sister, she attempts to rush back to the girl's side.

Vi: Powder! Pow...

Marcus catches her from behind. He holds a drugged cloth over her nose and mouth, lulling her unconscious and dragging her away.

Marcus: Shh. He'll kill you if he hears you. Come on. Let's go.

----------------

## Silco

Silco's remaining henchmen meet up with him. One of them is carrying an unconscious Sevika.

Silco: Hello, little girl.

Silco is hiding a knife behind his back.

Silco: Where's your sister? 

Powder responds by leaping into Silco's arms so forcefully that it knocks him to the ground and makes him drop the knife.

Powder (Still crying): She left me. She is not my sister anymore.

After a moment of hesitation, Silco seems to sympathize with Powder's plight. He wraps his arms around her and comforts her.

Silco: It's okay. We'll show them. We will show them all.

----------------

## Jayce

Several years after the events of the previous episode, Jayce enters Heimerdinger's office.

- You wanted to see me, Professor? - Ah.
Come in, Jayce.
-Can you believe it? Our city is about to turn 200 years old.
A bicentennial.
It's shaping up to be an amazing Progress Day.

Jayce inquires about a statue

"Stanwick Padidly"? Huh, I don't know much about him.
Everything he built either exploded, melted, or toppled over.
And yet, here he stands.
Stanwick set his personal ambitions aside and focused on something far more important.
Our future.
He realized nothing he could accomplish could compare to the contributions of his students.
I had no idea.
That was his sacrifice.
A dear friend.
The Council has recommended you give the Progress Day speech this year.
Whatâ¦ But you always give that speech.
Iâ¦ I could never take your place.
I agree with them.
Your Hexgates have done wonders for our city.
Brought scholars from distant lands.
Reignited passions in arts and science.
You deserve this honor.
Iâ¦ I will do my best to make Piltover proud, Professor.
It's short notice, I know, but perhaps there's something in the lab you might be able to share? People love a grand reveal.
Viktor and I have just the thing.
The next chapter of Hextech.
Come to the lab this afternoon, I'll show you.
I'll look forward to it.
You certainly have something to live up to, my boy.

At the Progress Day festival, Mrs. Kiramman introduces Jayce, her "famous protégé," to a group of attendees. He excuses himself to banter with Caitlyn, now an enforcer, who is guarding her family's tent. She laments that her mother gave her the post to keep her out of danger.

Happy Progress Day.
Happy Progress Day.
Our most famous protÃ©gÃ©, Jayce Talis.
The visionary behind the Hexgates, a beacon of trade and prosperity for our great City of Progress.
Excuse me.
Sorry, sorry.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
-He's a very busy man.
- Cait.
- Serves you right.
You still avoiding her? I'm working.
Oh, I can see that.
I mean, there's so much crime to thwart outside your family's tent.
I can only imagine the strings she pulled to have me posted here.
It's your fault really, for not following her into a career "more befitting your station.
" She'd do anything to keep me from seeing the real world.
Well, at least you'll have front-row seats to the speech.
Speech? Mm-hmm.
I'm giving the big address tonight.
Hmm.
We really have descended to anarchy.
Have fun herding the drunkards.
Happy Progress Day.

----------------

## Sevika

On a nearby airship dock, Silco's henchmen (led by Sevika) prepare a large shipment of shimmer. They are attacked from above by Firelight Crest Firelights, a gang of masked vigilantes known for their flying hoverboards. The Firelights subdue the henchmen using grenades that imprison their target within a shell of amber-colored crystals. The Firelight leader starts a stopwatch, saying that the crystals will only hold for five minutes. Poring over the vast quantities of shimmer, the leader remarks that Silco's operations are expanding. He orders the Firelights to check for more shimmer below deck, and to "burn it all."

Uh, shipping manifest? From your friend.
Downtown.
Let's go! Ah, shit.
The Firelights.
We have five minutes till they're out of there.
You ever seen this much Shimmer before? They're expanding.
Check for more below.
Burn it all.

----------------

## Jinx?

Two Firelights descend below deck and trigger a tripwire that locks the door shut behind them. Seeing a crude drawing of a monkey on the door, they realize that this is the work of a teenage Powder, now known as Jinx Jinx. Another device activates, dangling a doll in front of the Firelights which attaches several grenades to each of their bodies. The devices explode, killing the pair.

-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Open up.
Open the door.
Oh, no.
She's here.
What the.. Hi.

Jinx emerges onto the top deck and begins dispatching the remaining Firelights. One of them moves to set the shimmer ablaze with a flare, but Jinx grabs her arm and pistol-whips her, dislodging her mask. Revealed to be a human girl with pink hair, the Firelight bears a resemblance to Vi Vi, causing Jinx to become frozen stiff by a sudden surge of traumatic memories. In Jinx's stupor, the Firelight drops the flare, igniting the shimmer, and breaks free of Jinx's grasp. Jinx responds by firing her shock pistol, killing the girl. The Firelight leader cries out and rushes to shake the girl awake, but she doesn't move. He checks his stopwatch, realizing that his five minutes are almost up. Enraged, he makes a wild attack against Jinx, but is quickly grabbed and carried away by another Firelight on a hoverboard. Jinx erratically fires her minigun, Pow-Pow, at the fleeing Firelights, pincushioning the ship's hull with bullet holes and wounding one of her allies, but the Firelights escape unscathed. Sevika finally breaks free from the crystals and angrily confronts Jinx for failing to guard the cargo.

Vi? I can't lose you.
Why did you leave me? Because you're a jinx.
- I want to fight.
- You're not ready.
No.
You were supposed to guard the cargo.

----------------

## Jayce

Heimerdinger arrives at Jayce's lab, where Jayce and Viktor display several new inventions. First is a newly fortified hex crystal: unlike normal crystals which are extremely volatile and dangerous, these smooth, marble-like crystals can withstand great force and are completely safe. This allows them to design portable devices, such as the Atlas gauntlets, a pair of robotic hands created to assist miners, granting the wielder strength enough to crush boulders. In addition, Viktor demonstrates the hex claw, a mechanical arm equipped with a powerful laser, designed to assist artificers. Heimerdinger is impressed, but estimates that these devices will need a "decade" of additional research before they can be released to the public, since putting that type of power in everyone's hands would be dangerous without safeguards. Viktor is disheartened, eager to start improving lives immediately.

You think he will approve? Heimerdinger believes science should be used to improve lives as much as we do.
We just need to show him it's safe.
And what about the Council? We stabilized the crystal like they asked.
Built the Hexgates like they asked.
It's our turn to decide the future of Hextech.
Professor.
I'm so glad you could make it.
Wouldn't miss it for the world, my boy.
What do we have on the docket? It all began with this.
A crystal of magical energy, too volatile to be handled outside our workshops.
Hextech was supposed to bring magic into the life of the common man.
And now, it finally can.
A Hextech Gemstone.
-Wait.
Holy sprockets.
We've found a means to fortify the crystals.
This new version is stable and absolutely safe.
We present to you the next chapter of Hextech.
We can now design portable devices.
Oh... The Gemstone can power virtually anything.
The Atlas Gauntlets.
The mining colonies in the fissures can work faster and without fatigue.
The Hex Claw.
A mechanical arm, equipped with a powerful ray of light.
Imagine what our artificers could do with such a device.
I want Hextech to be a tool for us to build a new world.
-And now, it's finally possible.
Anyway, this is our presentation.
Quite amazing, gentlemen.
You should be very proud.
Obviously, there are a few kinks to iron out and screws to be tightened, but give it a decade of careful research, and it will be ready.
A decade? Oh, don't worry, my boy.
It zips past you in the blink of an eye.
With respect, Professor.
We can be improving lives with Hextech now.
A breakthrough like this takes time, Viktor.
Putting that kind of power into everyone's hands is dangerous.
Keep at it and I'm sure you will discover a way to safeguard Hextech against misuse.

----------------

## Caitlyn

Caitlyn sneaks aboard the nearly-destroyed airship where the Firelights attacked, now an active crime scene. She takes photographs and examines the wreckage carefully. Following a trail of blood below deck, she discovers the henchman whom Jinx mistakenly shot, collapsed on the ground. She uses a cloth to stem his still-open wound as she begins questioning him. Marcus Marcus arrives, now the sheriff, and reprimands Caitlyn for interfering in this investigation while she's supposed to be guarding her family's tent. He punishes her with a graveyard shift and orders his officers to take the wounded henchman to Stillwater Prison.

There must've been four, five of them.
I don't know how they got inside.
You're from the undercity.
I didn't do anything.
She's crazy.
-Easy.
She shot me.
Who shot you? Who were you working for? - I can't.
He'll kill me.
- Who? -I can protect you.
Caitlyn Kiramman, why does that not surprise me? Interfering in an investigation, again.
You're supposed to be guarding your mother's tent.
I was, Sheriff, but she doesn't need it.
And clearly, this takes priority.
I realize you're used to getting your way, Kiramman, but we have a chain of command for a reason.
I understand.
But there's more going on here than just the smuggling.
- If I could just question him I could - I'll take it from here.
Since you're looking for more work, you can take the graveyard shift tonight at the fair.
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
I want this one on a boat to Stillwater prison.
Yes, sir.

----------------

## Sevika

Sevika returns to The Last Drop, which has been transformed by Silco into a raucous nightclub. In Silco's office, she blames Jinx for the lost shimmer, but Silco defends Jinx, saying it was Sevika who failed in her responsibility. Sevika storms out in frustration. Silco asks Jinx, who had been listening from the rafters, for her side of the story. Jinx explains her trauma response to the pink-haired girl, and Silco stresses that she needs to move on from the past. He says that Sevika will "clean up today's mess" and instructs Jinx to take some time off and focus on her gadgetry. Jinx storms off in a huff, just as Sevika did.

She fired on us.
There are always mishaps in battle.
The Firelights were her target and most are dead.
It wasn't a mishap, she froze up and lost her shit.
I could've handled those brats.
- She's a problem and we all know it.
- We? Who's we? I expect better from you than excuses.
It was your job to make sure things went smoothly.
You failed.
Don't disappoint me again.
The world's growing smaller every day, thanks to the Hexgates.
And now, we're cut off.
The topsiders are leaving us further and further behind.
What happened? She already told you.
I'm asking you.
One of those Firelight wackos was a girl.
- With pink hair.
- Hmmâ¦ Your sister's gone.
You know that as well as I do.
I know.
I know.
Sisters, right? You can't live with 'em, can't stuff 'em back in the ol' babymaker.
Today's screw-up will set us back weeks.
I'm sorry.
- I need to know that I can rely on you.
- Phew.
I'm doing this for us, Jinx.
All of us.
The sons and daughters of Zaun deserve more than their runoff.
It won't happen again.
I know.
Sevika will clean up today's mess.
Sevika? That ogre couldn't clean a dust bunny with a blowtorch.
She'll suffice.
You should focus on your gadgetry.
Ugh.
Take some time.
I don't need time.
Take it anyhow.

----------------

## Mel

At a lavish cocktail party, Mel is standing alone on a tall balcony. Elora Elora approaches, asking if she's tired of mingling. Mel bemoans that the only person worth her time is Jayce. As if on cue, Jayce arrives, asking to speak to Mel in private. After retreating to Mel's study, he explains that Heimerdinger thinks Jayce's inventions need more time and asks for her advice. Mel urges him to "give people a glimpse of the future," saying that investors and representatives from all over the world will be present at Jayce's speech and that Progress Day is the perfect time to reveal new creations.

Fundraiser's going well.
Your mother would be proud.
Hmmâ¦ Would she? Tired of mingling? Hmm.
These people have nothing new to offer me.
The only one actually worth my time is him.
The golden boy.
Ah, he's won Piltover's heart.
Oh, speak of the devil.
Could I borrow you for a minute? To what do I owe the pleasure? It's Heimerdinger.
When is it not? We've shown him our research.
He thinks we need more time.
It's Progress Day.
Representatives from all over the world have come to see what new wonders the City of Progress has to offer.
If there's a time to present a new creation, it is now.
Great.
Heimerdinger is a great scientist.
But he's old.
He only ever sees the past.
Piltover needs a leader who looks forward.
Someone like you.
You really believe that? Hextech has the potential to change everything.
The world is ready.
And I've already spoken to several potential investors.
Investors? Of course.
Everyone wants Hextech for themselves.
It's your speech.
Give the people a glimpse of the future.

----------------

## Jinx

Jinx returns to her lair, fashioned from the remnants of a massive airship engine hanging over a cavernous fissure. She vents her frustrations to crude effigies of Mylo and Claggor, complaining that Silco now thinks she's weak. However, her mood gradually improves as she starts to come up with a plan to prove herself.

It wasn't her.
It wasn't.
I know.
Justâ¦ just some wannabe street trash.
I got confused, that's all.
Now, he thinks I'm weak.
"Sevika will clean it up.
" Sevika's a regular Johnny-on-the-spot.
I'm not weak.
And I'm gonna show him.
Oh, I'm gonna show him.
You'll see.

----------------

## Viktor

Jayce prepares to deliver his Progress Day speech. He invites Viktor onstage with him, but Viktor declines due to stage fright. After Mrs. Kiramman introduces him, Jayce walks onstage to rambunctious applause. He compares his humble origins as a stonemason's scion to his current status as the creator of the hexgates, which have brought incredible prosperity to Piltover. Viktor prepares to unveil their latest inventions, but Jayce doubts himself and says that he'll be ready to reveal them at a later date. The crowd seems disappointed. However, he finishes by claiming that his creations will bring an end to the people's hardships, and that Piltover's future is bright. The crowd applauds once again, but Jayce sees that Mel and Elora have gotten up to leave.

Where were you? They were asking if I could do the address.
You should come up with me.
We're partners.
No, no.
Not in front of all of themâ¦ Youâ¦ have your speech prepared? Uh-huh.
An inspiration to Piltover's future and that of all humanity.
Please join me in welcoming to the stageâ¦ - Jayce Talis.
- Guess it's time.
Uh, good evening.
I know many of you probably didn't expect to see me here today.
And believe me, I'm just as shocked as you are.
My family and I are simple people.
In our factory, we made hammers.
They were probably used to cut the stones you're standing on right now.
No one in my life expected very much of me.
And that is precisely what makes this moment so extraordinary.
A few years ago, the Hexgates opened their ports to the world and made Piltover prosper beyond anything we could have ever imagined.
Butâ¦ we're not done yet.
This year, we've created something new for you.
Something thatâ¦ umâ¦ That we will share with youâ¦ â¦when the time is right.
Things that will bring an end to your hardships.
Whether you're the scion of our high houses, or an honest laborer from the underground.
We vow to keep pressing forward, for we are the City of Progress.
And our future is bright.

Afterwards, Caitlyn and a group of enforcers relax on the steps of the capitol building as they guard the now-empty festival setup late at night. The others are teasing her for her background of wealth and refinement when suddenly, a fire breaks out in a nearby building. They rush to the scene and hear the voice of a young girl crying for help from within. Some enforcers leave to notify the fire brigade, others start deploying extinguishers, and yet others begin searching for the child. However, they find that the child's voice is coming from a portable speaker hanging from the ceiling alongside numerous explosives. The artificial voice sours, becoming Jinx's voice, and Caitlyn sees a drawing of a monkey, nearly identical to the one she saw on the destroyed airship. She realizes that it's a trap, but it's too late, and the bombs detonate, collapsing the building. Six enforcers die in the blast, while others, including Caitlyn, are injured. Before losing consciousness, Caitlyn sees Jinx leaving the scene.

That it, then? I thought that Talis boy was some kind of genius.
Last year, didn't he launch a blimp halfway across the continent? Airship, actually.
An airship has a rigid metal hull.
It's not a blimp.
It's a balloon, ain't it? Sure as hell looks that way.
Pardon us, if we aren't quite so refined as you, milady.
What are you even doing here, Kiramman? Don't you have a cocktail party to attend? Fire.
Fire! - What's happening? - Get the fire brigade.
Help.
In here, please.
Help me.
Help.
It's so hot, please.
I'm trapped.
I'm a helpless little girl and I've set the building on fire.
By accident.
Totally by accident.
Get out.
Now.
Also, I brought this dynamite.
Goodbye.

----------------

## Jayce

The following morning, Jayce and Viktor inform Marcus and the Council that the perpetrator of this crime also stole one of the fortified hex crystals and some of their research papers. When asked if the undercity could create a weapon with the stolen crystal, Jayce admits that it's possible. He recommends suspending all hextech operations, including the hexgates, until the situation is resolved, but the Council is reluctant to halt foreign commerce. Mel proposes that Jayce be given a seat on the Council so that he'll have the resources to assist in this investigation as he chooses. Heimerdinger seconds the motion, prompting Mel to call a vote.

The Gemstone is gone.
Along with some of our research papers.
The situation is still developing.
No one in the undercity has claimed responsibility yet.
How did it come to this? Hmm.
For too long has the underground been left unchecked.
We've lost touch.
They may not be your preferred constituents but they're still our people.
The undercity cannot be controlled.
Not by us.
So where does that leave us? Mr.
Talis? Could the trenchers build a weapon with the stolen crystal? Shimmer, body replacementsâ¦ We've seen their ingenuity over the years, of course, they can.
If the right person got a hold of it, it's possible they could utilize its energy.
We need to address this immediately.
I agree.
It was my responsibility to safeguard this technology and I failed.
My mistake cost people their lives.
I have come before you to recommend that we suspend all Hextech operations until the situation is resolved.
Including our laboratories, the refinery and the Hexgates.
Have you lost your mind? The Hexgates must remain open.
Piltover's status as a global shipping lane depends on it.
Thousands would lose their income.
But shouldn't the safety of Piltover be our first priority? You would sacrifice your life's work? Without the Hexgates, my goods cannot reach foreign markets till winter.
Am I to tell the Noxians their next shipment of wine will be vinegar? Councilors.
It appears we are at an impasse.
If we shut down the Hexgates, the city will suffer.
But if we do nothing, we leave ourselves vulnerable to malefactors.
More lives may be lost.
Perhaps the time has come to explore a more radical solution.
What are you suggesting? Mr.
Talis has demonstrated his commitment to our safety.
He's willing to sacrifice his own enterprise.
And it seems to me only Mr.
Talis has the knowledge necessary to secure the Hexgates.
I propose that a new chair be brought forth, and that House Talis be elevated to this august body.
- What? - As a Councilor, he will have the resources necessary to protect all our investments.
Councilor Medarda, his is highly irregular.
The Council has held seven seats for generations.
Does the boy have any experience? Only that of a scientist.
Like Heimerdinger.
I believe Councilor Medarda is right.
Hextech security should be administered by a scientist.
I second the motion.
Well then, shall we vote?

----------------

## Jinx

Back in her lair, Jinx is hard at work on new gadgets. Silco arrives, furiously reprimanding her for destroying a building and killing enforcers. However, she gives him the fortified hex crystal she stole, setting off a fireworks display and hugging Silco to earn his approval. Finally, he seems pleased.

 Jinx! Jinx! Jinx! Jinx! That's me.
Half a dozen enforcers, dead.
Enforcers.
Dead.
- Yeah... - A building blown to pieces.
Oh, yeah.
Do you have any idea what you've done? Actually, I do.
Happy Progress Day!

----------------

## Caitlyn

In her bedroom, Caitlyn is attempting to make sense of recent events via a sprawling, interconnected display of evidence and photographs pinned to a map of Piltover and Zaun. Jayce arrives with flowers, but Caitlyn is uninterested, tossing them in with the many other flowers she's received during her recovery. She explains her findings: she believes that the perpetrators of the failed smuggling operation were also responsible for the recent attack. Nearly all of the undercity's ongoing violence, she reasons, can be traced back to a single source. Jayce is unsure if any of her theories can be proven. He reveals that he's been made a councilor and invites her to join his security team, since her parents have just had her discharged from the enforcers. She rejects his "charity" and tells him to leave.

Hey.
How are you feeling? I've had a break in the case.
Shouldn't you be resting? While the trail is hot? Listen, you know how I've suspected there is a single mind behind the undercity's violence? The great conspiracy.
I think whoever attacked the square is our suspect.
The same symbols showed up at the botched smuggling operation at the Hexgates.
- The Hexgates? - Keep up.
All this time, they've kept their dealings localized to the undercity.
Low priority.
The attack on the square changes things.
They've overstepped.
If I can figure who made this, it could lead me directly to whoever's behind it all.
The answer is here, staring me in the face.
I can feel it.
How do you intend to prove any of this? If I can just work this out.
Marcus will have to listen.
If there's one thing I've learned about the Council, they need more than just theories.
Since when did you concern yourself with the Council's opinion? Since I uh, became a Councilor.
You're serious.
When? Why? Have they discovered how to govern with grease and a spanner? Ha ha.
I was actually hoping you might consider joining my staff.
"House Talis Security.
" That's a ceremonial position.
I'd live behind a desk.
You almost died, Cait.
I justâ¦ I just want you to be safe.
Thanks, but I already have a job.
No.
You don't.
After the attack, your parents spoke to the Sheriff.
This is the best I could do.
I don't need charity, Councilor.
Yours or my parents'.
- Cait.
- Get out.

Caitlyn takes a ferry to Stillwater Prison and asks to speak with the henchman she found aboard the airship, inmate 2135. The warden reveals that the inmate was assaulted by another prisoner and is unable to speak due to his injuries. Instead, Caitlyn goes to talk with the prisoner who attacked him. Alone in a cell on the fortieth basement level, she finds the prisoner in question: Vi.

I need to speak with one of the inmates.
Oh, folks in here aren't usually very talkative.
This one was hit by friendly fire.
He's got reason to talk.
Must have been sent in today? Oh.
Inmate 2135.
Yeah, I'm, uh, afraid that's not possible.
- Why not? - Uh, well, there's beenâ¦ - an incident.
- What kind of incident? -Theâ¦ â¦not so pretty kind.
You don't understand, I have to talk to him.
Oh, you'll be able to.
As soon as he can move his jaw again.
Who assaulted him? Who the hell are you?

We flash back to a scene from Caitlyn Caitlyn's childhood. She charges through a forest with a rifle, quickly but carefully shooting small wooden targets as metal arms thrust them into view, racing against Grayson Grayson to see who can be faster. Finally, she shoots the last target, but sees Grayson taking aim and holding her shot against the same one.

Later, a party celebrates Caitlyn's victory, but she leaves her trophy on a set of stairs and confronts Grayson outside, asking if her parents paid Grayson to let her win. Grayson is coy at first, but admits that while she wasn't paid, she did let Caitlyn win, simply because she thought the child deserved it. She explains that, as an enforcer, learning to shoot allows her to protect people, which is reward enough, and asks Caitlyn what she's shooting for.

-Hmm.
That was quite some shooting, Kiramman.
Did my parents pay you to let me win? Hmm... That's a serious accusation.
You held your shot, I saw you.
The trophy is yours.
You earned it.
You haven't answered my question.
No, your parents didn't pay me.
I just thought you deserved it.
I'm an enforcer.
For me, knowing how to handle this weapon means being able to protect people.
To be of service to the city.
And that's trophy enough.
Begs the question, young Kiramman.
What are you shooting for?

----------------

## Caitlyn/Vi?

Back in the present day, Caitlyn interrogates Vi, but Vi answers all of her questions sarcastically, giving her nothing. Frustrated, Caitlyn starts to leave, with Vi telling her to "give Silco Silco a kiss." Caitlyn returns, asking about Silco, but Vi remains obstinate. Hesitantly, Caitlyn steps over a red line on the ground, getting close enough that Vi can reach her through the metal bars. She shows Vi a picture of Jinx Jinx's monkey drawings from the crime scenes. Suddenly interested, Vi asks where Caitlyn got this. Caitlyn asks if inmate 2135 worked for Silco. Vi is incredulous that she didn't already know this, saying "they all do." Caitlyn asks for proof, and Vi says she can get it, but not from within a jail cell.

I took a look at your file.
There's no record of you or your crimes.
What are you here for? My sunny personality.
You attacked an inmate.
Why? Why not? He was a witness in an ongoing investigation.
Hmm, bummer.
This was a waste of time.
Couldn't have put it better.Hey, give Silco a kiss on that winning eye of his, will you? Silco? The industrialist? Okay, this is getting old.
Can you just send in whoever's gonna kick the shit out of me, so I can get on with my night? Does this mean anything to you? -Where did you get this? - My question first.
He worked for Silco? - Uh, they all do.
How can anyone not know that? Where did you find this? There was an attack.
This is evidence.
I need proof if I'm to believe what you're saying about Silco.
I could get it for you.
Just not from in here.
In what mad world would I trust someone like you? Someone like me? You enforcers are all the same.
Just asshole criminals in fancy uniforms.
You know what? Find Silco yourself.
I will, thank you.
Hmm... Undercity's gonna eat you alive.

Caitlyn is reluctant to trust Vi and goes to leave. Later, she returns with orders from Jayce for Vi's release.

I've got orders from Councilor Talis, concerning Inmate 516.
Not cooperative, huh? You, uh, you want us to have a chat with her? - No.
- Oh.
It's for her release.
Huh.
Since when's he a Councilor? Since today.
How many chats have you had with her? You know, I never even thought to count.

----------------

## Marcus (rearrange?)

Marcus delivers a somber speech at the funeral of the six enforcers killed by Jinx. He and his daughter, Ren, also visit Grayson's grave.

These brave Enforcers sacrificed their lives to defend the values of our great city.
To some, they are mothers... fathers, sons... daughters... but to all, they are heroes.
Who was this, Daddy? A good woman.

----------------

## Marcus

Later, in Silco's office, Marcus furiously argues with Silco over the deaths of his enforcers. He wants to arrest Jinx, arguing that Silco can't control her. Silco instead suggests that he pins these crimes on the Firelights. Marcus is reluctant to play along, but begrudgingly accepts.

You said you could control her.
I lost six officers.
Six! She pushed it too far this time.
The Council's up in arms.
I can't make this go away for you unless you give me something to work with.
-Arresting her would be doing you a favor.
I don't need favors.
I need you to do your job.
The Firelights have been a thorn in both our sides.
They ambushed my shipment at the Hexgates on the same day as the attack.
It seems to me the Council has its culprit.
Oh, that's tidy for you.
What if I'm not interested in playing along? We've accomplished a lot together, Marcus.
Sheriff.
And there is more yet to achieve.
I hope you can remain a part of it.
For their families.
From an anonymous, concerned citizen.

----------------

## Jayce

Jayce goes through the hexgate logs and finds far more discrepancies than he anticipated. Viktor is wholly uninterested in Jayce's politics and wants him to refocus on science, reminding him that the people who need their help can't wait. Marcus arrives, and Jayce is aggressive in his push for Marcus to take this corruption seriously, providing him with a list of suspicious transactions. Marcus tells him that the Firelights are their chief suspect. Viktor loses focus, coughing up blood as his vision becomes hazy. Jayce asks if he's all right, but Viktor brushes him off and returns to the lab.

Yesterday's smuggling fiasco was nothing.
These manifests are full of discrepancies, dating back months.
This is a poor use of our time.
I'm a Councilor now, Viktor.
It's my responsibility to make sure the Hexgates are safe and protected.
What about our pledge to improve lives, for those in need? For the undercity? Look, I'm sorry I didn't announce our other projects in my speech.
- Soon, we can do everything we - Soon? There are people who need our help now, Jayce.
You wanted to see me? Have your people ever reviewed these logs? - Mr.
Talis, I assure you - Councilor.
And the only assurance I need is that you will search and seize any unauthorized merchandise.
I've made a list of suspicious transactions.
All due respect, Councilor, - today's your first day - Second.
Right.
You sure you don't want to confer with the other Councilors before This corruption runs deep, Sheriff.
I intend to root it out.
Have you made any progress with the stolen Gemstone? -Yes.
Chief suspect is an undercity gang.
They call themselves the Firelights.
They operate like phantoms, doing hit-and-runs on civilians and disappearing into the night.
- How soon till we track them down? - I've got my best officers on it.
Viktor? You all right? Aâ¦ a headache.
I justâ¦ I need to get to the lab.

----------------

## Jinx

Jinx prepares a hextech device based on Jayce and Viktor's notes, but as she activates it, it emits a powerful pulse of light and energy, somewhat resembling the explosion that killed her family. Unable to bear the painful reminder, she flees the device in tears.

Boringâ¦ Boring.
Wow.
Super boringâ¦ Here we go! It's all about these runes.
They form some kind of math-y, magic-y gateway.
To the realm of heebie-jeebies.
And thisâ¦ Turns it on.
Soâ¦ here goes.
No! No! It was a mistake! It was a mistake.

----------------

## Caitlyn

Caitlyn brings Vi to a train leading down into Zaun.

I heard the bathysphere has a nice view.
That could be a good way to get a lay of the land.
Too risky.

Vi begins leaping across rooftops, deftly freerunning into the city below.

Caitlyn: What...

Reluctantly, Caitlyn follows her, but isn't nearly as light on her feet, navigating the climb slowly and clumsily.

On the ground, a pair of street thugs confront Vi, but she dispatches them before Caitlyn finally catches up with her.

Vi: Nice jacket.

Vi dons one of the thugs' jackets and tosses the other's clothing to Caitlyn so that she can change out of her enforcer uniform.

Welcome to the Lanes.
You almost got me killed.
My little sister could do that when she was seven.
All us fissure folk can.
Don't you want to blend in?

----------------

## Viktor

Back in the lab. He tinkers with a levitating device covered in interchangeable runes, later referred to as the "hex core".

You had a vision? What if we've been looking at it backwards? We've been trying to discover runes that invoke specific effects and then molding them to a useful function.
Tools, as you like to put it.
But, butâ¦ If the legends are true, mages aren't bound to single functions.
It's said the Arcane speaks through them.
I'm still not following.
They think.
They adapt.
You think Hextech canâ¦ learn? Are you sure this is safe? Of course not.

----------------

## Vi

Vi takes Caitlyn to a food stall run by a man named Jericho and voraciously wolfs down a bowl of cooked fish covered in sauce. Caitlyn asks Vi what information Jericho can offer, but Vi reveals that she was simply hungry. However, Jericho slides Vi a napkin on which he's drawn a sigil. Vi takes the napkin and the pair depart.

Oh, Jericho! Have I missed these.
Hmm? No.
Thank you.
You're missing out.
Are you going to question him? About what? The meat? Definitely not above board.
Silco.
His connections? Isn't that why we're here? We're here because I'm hungry.
Do you know what prison food is like? No, of course, you don't.
Unbelievable.
I didn't break you out of jail to eat... slop.
I knew this was a terrible idea.
You don't actually know anything, do you? Mm.
Better than I remember.

----------------

## Mel

Jayce and Mel attend a theatre performance, sitting in a mezzanine box while a musician plays a unique-looking hybrid instrument.

Hmm.
I haven't been here in years.
Since my parents brought me for the winter fest.
We're not here for the performance.
Your House is in trouble.
That merchant formerly enjoyed certain leniencies with regard to her trade in exchange for her generous Academy patronage.
By leniencies you mean corruption? Hmm, Amara's harmless.
Oh, look at those two stooges.
Councilors Hoskel and Salo.
Don't they hate each other? Hmm.
But they share a taste for the finer Noxian spirits, technically an illegal import.
I tightened our security.
And in so doing, put a target on your back.
There are those who covet your power over the wealth the Hexgates afford.
And would take any opportunity to seize it from you.
You've just made yourself everyone's common enemy, Jayce.

----------------

## Jinx

Jinx revisits the abandoned arcade from her childhood, which appears to have remained untouched in the years since her last visit. She restores a punching machine whose scoreboard is covered in Vi's name. Memories of her sister bubble to the surface once again as she furiously takes out her frustration on the machine. At last, her name appears second on the scoreboard, just short of Vi's high score.

Oh, what's the matter, Mylo? You worried Powder's gonna beat you again.
Vander.
Because you're a jinx! What makes you different makes you strong.
Hmm.

----------------

## Vi

Vi sees that The Last Drop has been taken over by Silco and is moved to anger.

Caitlyn: Well, that place does look like it has bodies buried in the basement.

Vi: You don't know anything.

----------------

## Jayce

Back at the theatre, Jayce is reluctant to compromise the safety of the hexgates for the other councilors' corruption, but Mel assures him that he'd simply be doing "favors amongst friends" and as a symbol of the future, he has the potential to shape his own destiny. Amara, one of the merchants he inadvertently crossed, arrives at Mel and Jayce's box, bemoaning how she'd been confronted by enforcers that morning. Mel assures her that Jayce is willing to reinstate former trade privileges to those who "share his vision." Finally, Jayce plays along, striking a deal with Amara. He further entices Amara with exclusive perks from his hextech enterprise as a partner in exchange for her financial and political support. One by one, he visits the other councilors (except Heimerdinger) in their boxes, making similar arrangements with each one, much to Mel's pleasure.

I can't compromise the safety of the Hexgates for collateral.
No one's asking you to.
These are simply favors amongst friends.
I never wanted anything to do with politics.
You pushed this on me.
You're a symbol of the future now, Jayce, whether you like it or not.
With that comes the potential to shape your own destiny.
The Council assumes you'll fail.
Time to prove them all wrong.
Once again.
Welcome, Amara.
How's little Rohan? Councilor Medarda.
Councilor Talis.
He's just as precocious as ever.
I had quite a shock this morning.
Enforcers banging on my door.
Oh, I hope you'll understand, Jayce had to make a show of safety.
But he's here now to negotiate all his deals personally.
Councilor Talis is willing to reinstate former trade privileges to those who share his vision.
Can we count you amongst them? Councilor Bolbok seems to think other arrangements would be more profitable.
The man's a fool.
With him, you'd be investing in the past.
With us, you'd be investing in the future.
You know, Councilor Medarda's right.
The Hexgates are only the beginning.
In fact, we're currently looking for new partners in our Hextech research, and as a supporter of House Talis, you'd be the first in line to any of our advancements.
How can I say no to such an auspicious offer? Hextech partners? Has a nice ring, doesn't it? Mm.Your audience awaits, Councilor.
He's been quite the investment.
Indeed.
Better than expected.

----------------

## Vi

Vi and Caitlyn visit a brothel whose door is marked with the sigil given to them by Jericho. Caitlyn, clearly out of her element, asks Vi what her plan is. Vi suggests Caitlyn pretend to be a prostitute, but Caitlyn scoffs at the idea. Vi advises her that the way to make people talk to her is to act like you have what they want. Caitlyn asks what she has, to which Vi responds, "You're hot, cupcake." She grabs a patron by the arm, who introduces himself as Pim, and leaves him to mingle with Caitlyn. She enters the office of the brothel's madam, Babette, who is shocked to see her.

The one place all the secrets are spilled.
Oh.
How exactly do you propose we go about this? -Let 'em think you work here.
Excuse me? I will not.
You know what your problem is? Please.
Tell me.
You expect everyone to give you what you want.
If you really want people to talk to you, you have to let them think you have what they want.
And what do I have? You're hot, cupcake.
So what'll it be, man or woman? -Um... Hi.
I'm Pim.
What's your name? Matilda.
But you can call her whatever you want.
Ah, yes.
Matilda.
My parents named me Matilda.
After my great-grandmother Matilda, the, uh...

----------------

## Silco

Marcus visits Silco's office, warning him that Jayce is now a councilor and is on the path to discovering Marcus and Silco's relationship. Silco offers him one of Jinx's grenades, suggesting he pass it off as proof of the Firelights' guilt. Marcus laments that "this has gone too far" and imagines himself pulling the grenade's pin, killing himself and Silco. Silco dares him to do it, but in the end, he simply walks away. Silco tells Jinx, who is once again listening from the rafters, that she needs to weaponize hextech soon. Jinx asserts that she is unable due to her trauma association with the hex crystal, but Silco is insistent.

Would you believe it? Sheriff, what a lovely surprise.
The Hextech wonder boy is on the Council now, and he's asking questions.
It's only a matter of time before he finds the truth.
What is truth, but a survivor's story? If I'm discovered, we're both finished.
Good thing you've located proof of the Firelights' involvement.
This has gone too far.
Hmm? Imagining yourself a hero? One final act to make you the martyr you've always seen yourself as? Then what are you waiting for? -Ah, he's faltering.
You need to weaponize the Hextech soon.
Once we've cracked their prize, topside will have no power over us.
I can't do it.
Just... give it to the doctor.
You're the only one I can trust with this, Jinx.
I keep... seeing them.
That day.
Fear haunts us all, child.

----------------

## Vi

Babette tells Vi that no one has been able to stop Silco since Vander Vander's death. Vi asks about Powder, but Babette knows nothing. However, she reveals that Sevika is a regular at the brothel and offers to have one of her staff, Miguel, tell Vi where to find her. As Vi leaves the brothel, she sees Caitlyn chatting with another patron. Caitlyn now looks far more comfortable and relaxed than when she arrived. Vi seems impressed at the adjustment.

Sweetheart, I was real sad to hear about Vander.
And the kids.
Just terrible.
By the looks of it, no one down here lifted a finger to stop Silco.
A few tried but Silco's got the muscle... and the money.
He took over the Last Drop.
I saw.
Things have changed without Vander looking out for us.
Have you heard anything about Powder? I think Silco has her.
I have to find her.
Silco's number two's a regular.
I can have Miguel tell you where to find her.
I owe you.
It's nothing.

----------------

## Jayce

Mel commends Jayce for his work at the theatre and they fondly discuss the future of hextech. Suddenly, Mel kisses him.

I've only ever imagined the gardens... This is all I've seen.
You did well today.
I had a good teacher.
It's only a matter of time before those old fools on the Council -officially accept your research.
My father put hammers in the hands of the people, and they built this magnificent city.
Imagine the wonders they could create if we put magic in their hands.
The world will never be the same.
The Medardas usually only take from the world.
We're not often in the position to give anything back.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Hmm.

Mel and Jayce have sex.

----------------

## Viktor

Meanwhile, Viktor continues experimenting with the hex core, unable to figure out why it isn't working. His assistant, Sky, offers to walk him home, but he rejects her, saying he's going to sleep in the lab tonight. He resumes his work, eventually getting frustrated and throwing his notes in the air. At that moment, his vision becomes hazy once again, and he coughs blood onto the table. Mel and Jayce go to bed together. Viktor collapses, unconscious, as his blood reacts to the hex core. It begins pooling towards the core until a single drop levitates off the table and begins weaving itself into the fabric of the device.

It's beautiful.
I can't figure out why it's not working.
You will.
Are you headed home soon? I thought we could walk together.
I'm, uh, probably going to sleep here tonight.
Again? You know there's always tomorrow, right? Good night, Miss Young.
Mm.

----------------

## Jinx/Silco

Silco takes Jinx to the waters where Vander tried to drown him. He explains that he let a weak man die on that day, and a new one was reborn. If Jinx wishes to overcome her pain, he says, she needs to let Powder die. He tells her to be strong, saying that "Jinx is perfect." Finally, he submerges her in the river as if baptizing her.

I almost drowned in these waters.
You told me a million times.
Vander wasn't the man you thought he was.
Right, he was like a brother to you, and he turned his back and blah, blah, blah.
Did I miss anything? I've got a new one for you.
That day, I let a weak man die.
And another was reborn.
Betrayal, that pain that feels like it'll eat you from the inside out, can either break you or forge you into something greater.
You need to let Powder die.
So the fear of pain will no longer control you.
You're strong now.
Just like you were always meant to be.
Jinx is perfect.

----------------

## Marcus (rearrange?)

Marcus ponders the grenade given to him by Silco, alongside a framed drawing by his daughter. Enraged, he shatters his drink.

----------------

## Mel (redundant?)

Mel wakes up alone, realizing that Jayce is gone.

----------------

## Jayce

Jayce sits next to a hospital bed, where Viktor lies unconscious. As Viktor wakes up, Jayce struggles to explain what the doctors told him. Viktor fills in the gaps, asking how much time he has left.

Jayce? Viktor, the doctors, um, they said you're... How much time do I have?

----------------

## Vi

Vi finds Sevika gambling over a game of cards. Vi interrupts Sevika's card game with a knee to the face. Sevika's opponents grab a handful of coins and run. Sevika removes her cloak, revealing a mechanical prosthetic arm, able to her inject her with shimmer on command. They fight relentlessly, Vi eventually pinning Sevika to the ground. She asks where her sister is, and Sevika says that Jinx works for Silco now. This shocks Vi enough for her to let her guard down momentarily, and Sevika stabs in her in the gut with knife-like mechanical fingers. She's about to kill Vi, but takes a shot to the shoulder from Caitlyn's rifle and flees. Caitlyn helps Vi to her feet and the two hobble away.

Rotten luck, boys! Vi? You filthy traitor.
Vander had his chance.
I see you never learned patience.
Where's my sister? Where's he keeping her? Keeping her? You mean Jinx? She works for him.
She's like his daughter.
I'll give her your regards.
Why did you let her go? Do you ever say "thank you?" - He's gonna know we're here now.
- Whose fault is that? You're an all-right shot.
I'm an excellent shot.
You gonna help me out, cupcake? Stop calling me that.
My name is Caitlyn.
But you're so sweet.
Like a cupcake.
Shut up.

----------------

## Jinx

Jinx finally solves hextech, creating a machine similar to the one Jayce built when he first unlocked its potential.

----------------

## Silco

A wounded Sevika shuffles back to Silco's office, leaking shimmer on the floor. She tells Silco that Vi is back. Silco is dumbfounded, having believed the girl was dead.

You're making a mess.
The sister.
She's back.
From the dead?

----------------

## Viktor

We flash back to a scene from Viktor's childhood. While other children swim in the water, Viktor winds up a mechanical toy boat. He is seen briefly by Sky, but the girl soon returns to playing with the other kids. Viktor sets the boat in the water and it begins sailing downstream. As it picks up speed with the current, Viktor is unable to keep up with it due to his bad leg. It descends into a cave, but Viktor follows it. When it finally comes to rest, it is found by Singed, who is sitting in the cave with his pet waverider, Rio.

Whoo! Come over here, come on! Sky? Don't be afraid.
You built this? Why aren't you playing with the others? Hm.
Loneliness is often the byproduct of a gifted mind.
What is it? Hmm? Oh.
This is Rio.
She's a rare mutation that I cultivated.
Here.
-Go on.
Hmm.
-She's dying.
I'm attempting to prevent that.
The mutation must survive.
Can I help? You want to assist me? Very well.
We can be loners together.

Back in the present day, Viktor sits on a ledge overlooking the same pool of water from his youth. Heimerdinger approaches.

Good to see some things haven't changed.
Seems just yesterday I stumbled upon an aspiring young scholar from the undercity here, ruminating in his steel oasis.
I heard your prognosis.
I'm terribly sorry, my boy.
Do you contemplate death, Professor? Only that of friends.
I suppose your legacy has been well-secured.
As one of Piltover's founders, what haven't you to show for your remarkable life? You should be proud of what you've accomplished, Viktor.
Figments.
My contributions will be short-lived, even in your memory.
I have seen many students.
It's a sad truth that those who shine brightest often burn fastest.

----------------

## Mel

Jayce walks in on Mel painting a picture of the Immortal Bastion from her home nation of Noxus. He apologizes for disappearing the previous night, but she remains irate. After a moment, he breaks the news that Viktor is dying. He theorizes that his illness is due to the gases he was exposed to while living in Zaun Crest icon Zaun, lamenting that he wants to solve real issues, not just trade disputes, and hates feeling so useless. Mel admits that she's an exile from her family, having fallen short of "Medarda standards." She tells Jayce that he should be with Viktor, saying that while we can't change fate, we don't have to face it alone.

I didn't know you were an artist.
Hm.
There's quite a lot about me you don't know.
Listen, I'm sorry for disappearing last night.
-Duty calls.
Viktor's dying.
I think it has something to do with gasses in the fissures where he grew up.
Exactly the sort of thing we wanted to fix with Hextech.
Improving lives.
Solving real issues, not just trade disputes.
Viktor saved my life once.
Now, he needs me and there's nothing I can do.
I hate feeling so useless.
I didn't realize you were so close.
He's like my brother.
Why did you come to me with this? I justâ¦ Nothing feels impossible when I'm with you.
I'm an exile from my family.
What? Why? I fell short of Medarda standards.
I don't believe that for a second.
Do you? You should be with him, Jayce.
We can't change what fate has in store for us, -but we don't have to face it alone.
It's a beautiful painting.

----------------

## Viktor

Viktor stares endlessly, pondering the hex core. He begins to notice how it's changed after absorbing his blood. He touches it with his finger, and it reacts violently, causing his consciousness to slip once again.

----------------

## Jinx

Jinx visits the bar at The Last Drop. The bartender, Thieram, seems terrified of her, but pours her a drink.

Chuck!
Thieram. Uh... My name's Thieram.
Nice try, Chuck.
What's all the hubbub? Uh.
Boss wants us to grab someone up.
Someone? Anyone? - Who are you grabbing? - Some girls.
I mean, I mean not... I'm not grabbing girls.
Oh, other than then... those ones... I guess.
Focus.
Who are they? Why wasn't I invited to the party? Uh, I don't know.
They... they got in a fight with Sevika.
They did a number on her.
Oh really? Which number? It's like a saying... You're doing great, Chuck.
Here, for your troubles.

Jinx thanks him by attaching a grenade to his back, though it only explodes in glitter.

----------------

## Caitlyn

Caitlyn and Vi continue to elude the henchmen, but Vi can barely walk due to her wound. They come to the edge of a cliffside with an abandoned water tower situated at the bottom, metal supports reaching all the way up the rock wall. Vi jumps across the beams to reach the bottom, though her condition makes her sloppy. Caitlyn follows slowly.

Silco's goons aren't far behind.
We have to keep moving.
What the hell is that? The sign.
Never mind, just help me to the edge.
-Can you do this in your...
Shit.
Come on! Come on.
Let's go!

Standing on a distant structure, the Firelight leader Firelight leader sees them descend. ??
A group of henchmen sprint past the water tower, not thinking to check the hiding place below. ??

----------------

## Sevika

Sevika enters Silco's office, saying.

Sevika: We lost her.

The chair swivels around to reveal Jinx in Silco's seat.

Jinx: Lost who?

Sevika steps forward, stumbling into a tripwire and releasing a noxious green gas. Jinx dons a gas mask as Sevika attempts to reach her, but passes out. Some time later, Jinx slaps her awake; she's tied down to Silco's chair.

I feel like you and I got off on the wrong arm.
Maybe we should try the other.
No need.
It's your sister.
She's back.
She's looking for you.
It's not what you think.
She's with some girl enforcer.
Guess she replaced you.
You're lying! Why bother? Her back in town, it's only a matter of time before you implode and Silco finally gets the message that you're about as good for our cause as you were for your family.
-Jinx.

Jinx feigns crying, but sneezes in Sevika's face.

Jinx: Ten outta ten, toots! I think I know just how to deliver that message.

----------------

## Marcus

Marcus returns home and goes to check on his daughter, Ren. He finds her building a tower of blocks with Silco and two of his thugs.

Ah, about time Daddy joined us.
You were so busy, little Ren here saw me in.
Let's talk outside.
Can't you see we're playing? You remember our old friend Vi, don't you? Vander's daughter.
She was about your age.
Her father went on a long trip and Daddy here assured me that she left with him.
But it seems she never made it.
Isn't that sad? Could you imagine being separated from your father? She'sâ¦ in a safe place.
She's in the Lanes.
That's not possible.
There's an enforcer with her.
A girl.
Roughly the same age.
Caitlyn.
She's a Kiramman.
Just like them, she does whatever she wants.
I... can't control her.
Then of what use are you? I'll track her down.
I can fix this.
Please.
Everyone makes mistakes, right? What's important is that we don't repeat them.
-My people are tracking Vi and this... Caitlyn.
They cannot be allowed to resurface.
Do we understand each other? Hmm.
Hmm.

Silco misplaces a block, bringing the tower tumbling down.

Oops.
Ah.
So sorry.
Accidents happen.

----------------

## Jayce

Viktor demonstrates to Jayce that the hex core responds to organic matter, causing a small plant to experience massive growth, multiplying in size in a matter of seconds. Viktor theorizes that the hex core could lead to healing magic, which could augment physiology and extend life. Jayce surmises that it may be the key to saving Viktor's life, but the plant withers and dies moments later. Viktor explains that he's had the same result with every plant he's tried, but doesn't know why. He fears he may be running out of time. Trying to remain hopeful, Jayce offers to ask Heimerdinger for help.

Watch.
It responds to organic matter.
Incredible.
This is unlike anything we've ever seen, Jayce.
It, it, it could be the key to augmenting physiology, extending lifeâ¦ -Curing you.
It's happened to everyone.
I can't determine why.
They'reâ¦ rejecting the transmutation.
- We'll solve this.
- There may not be time.
We're in uncharted waters here andâ¦ I can feel my bodyâ¦ eroding.
I'll have Sky bring Heimerdinger.
He might know something that could help.
In the meantime, we'll do what we do best.

----------------

## Caitlyn

Caitlyn helps Vi to her feet. They stand before a large encampment of vagrants, all of whom appear malnourished or deformed, shying away from Caitlyn's flashlight. They turn away, retreating into the house at the base of the water tower. Caitlyn helps Vi onto a bench and reaches to dab her face with a handkerchief, but Vi swats her away. Vi is fading, and begins to see visions of her childhood, when she and Powder lived in this house with their parents. Caitlyn wants Vi to trust her, not seeming to understand why she hates Piltovans so much. Eventually, Vi allows Caitlyn to stem her still-bleeding wound with the handkerchief.

What is this place? It's where the kind of people you topsiders don't want to think about wind up.
It was never this big, though.
There.
I know you have your reservations about me, but this only works if we can trust each other.
It doesn't work.
It never has.
You topsiders always find a way to screw us.
I suppose topside is to blame for all your misfortunes.
-No.
Not all of them.
We aren't monsters, you know.
We're people, just like you.
You don't know anything about me.
I shouldn't have left you.
It's all right.
Despite it all, I can tellâ¦ you have a good heart.
-You've got a good heart.

## Viktor

Viktor and Jayce introduce Heimerdinger to the hex core. They explain its various functions, but Heimerdinger is distracted. He says that he's seen nations destroyed by arcane forces which looked "exactly like this" and insists that the hex core be destroyed. Jayce vehemently opposes him, saying that the hex core could save Viktor's life. Heimerdinger claims that this is a violation of the Ethos and vows to have it destroyed one way or another, storming away in anger. Viktor says he knows someone else who could help, but Jayce says he needs to get ready, to which Viktor asks, "For what?"

What is that? I'm calling it the Hexcore.
It's an adaptive rune matrix.
Hextech that evolves.
It's groundbreaking.
What's most exciting is that it reacts to biological matter.
There are stories of healing magic.
Our samples thus far have perished... You must destroy it.
What? Please, if ever you've put faith in my guidance, hear me now.
I've seen nations destroyed by a single seed and it looked... exactly like this.
Professor, this could save Viktor's life.
Viktor, something's different.
You've changed.
What did you do? What do you mean, Professor? It's that thing.
It must be destroyed! - Wait.
- No.
I won't let you.
-Jayce, this is a violation of the Ethos.
I will have it destroyed one way or another.
That's your opinion.
We'll see if the Council agrees.
I might know someone else who could help.
You do what you have to.
I need to get ready.
For what?

----------------

## Caitlyn

Vi starts to lose consciousness entirely. Caitlyn exits the house but is startled to find Huck standing there, asking if Vi is all right. Caitlyn trains her rifle on Huck. He has deformed purple growths on his body caused by the overuse of shimmer.

-Is she all right? Wait, wait, wait! Easy.
Easy.
That's Vi, right? I'm a friend.
Or at least I was.
I mean, I... I owed her old man my life.
Probably more than that.
I guess.
-She's bleeding.
She needs a doctor.
Not so simple to come by around here.
-Hey.
I'm sorry.
Oh, oh.
But, ah, I do know someone else who might be able to help.
Come with me.

He beckons Caitlyn to follow him into the camp, where they arrive at an apothecary's stall.

Ailment? Uh.. Uh... she's been stabbed.
She makes potions.
Helps people here with... with this.
Shimmer.
Why would you take something that does that to you? I just... wanted to feel what it was like... To be somebody.
To make other people afraid. Instead of...

The apothecary brings forth a potion.

-Trade.

Caitlyn empties the bullets from her rifle and passes it to the woman. In response, she adds a single drop of shimmer to the potion and slides it to Caitlyn.

-Thank you, I really Let's go.
I think Vi will be happy to see a friendly face.
No, no.
You go ahead.
She knew me when I was still... Anyway, I don't want her to see me like this.
Just tell her, uh, tell her I'm sorry.
About everything. Okay?

She embraces him in a hug before returning to the house.

----------------

## Jayce

Marcus gives Jinx's grenade to Jayce.

I found this on one of the Firelights.
It matches fragments we found outside your lab and at the Hexgates.
I... have reason to believe they're planning more attacks.
Well, how has this threat gone unnoticed for so long? Since the Hexgates were completed, the fissures haven't been a priority.
Oh, we'll settle that later.
For now, we need to prevent any further attacks.
Short of searching everyone who crosses the bridges.
I don't know how we can.
Then, that's what we'll do.
- Are you certain? This sort of an order - Do it.
We have to protect the city.
One other thing.
I saw Caitlyn Kiramman had a prisoner released on your order.
Is there anything I can assist with? No.
No, uh, we've got it covered.

Later, at a Council meeting.

Heimerdinger: Councilors, we have lost our way.
This city was founded to be a bastion of enlightenment.
In a world that cannibalized itself over power and pride.
But we've forgotten.
Loosened our morals in favor of comfort and convenience.
Traded honor for prestige.
We were once one tribe.
Now we are Houses divided.
I believe, if we set aside our greed and arrogance, we can be one again.
It will take vigilance.
We must hold each other accountable.
And who holds you accountable? What? Shimmer is rampant in the undercity.
Attacks at the Hexgates and in the Academy Square.
Enforcers fear to set foot in the Lanes.
All under your watch.
Jayce, you forget yourself.
I'm sorry, Professor, but healing this city will take more than just speeches.
Time and again, you've warned us what not to do.
But let me ask you this, what's your plan to fix this? I see what this is about.
Your Hextech projects need more time.
More safeguards.
Humans don't live for centuries.
We can't wait for progress.
We need a leadership focused on the future, not the past.
You are the true Father of Piltover, and your years of service can never be repaid.
I believe it's time we gave the beloved founder of our cityâ¦ a well-deserved retirement.
Jayce, don't do this.
Hmm.
It has to be unanimous.
All in favor? With my deepest respect and appreciation, Professor.

----------------

## Caitlyn

Caitlyn feeds(wording?) the potion to a barely conscious Vi. She screams awake, eyes briefly turning purple from the shimmer, and notices that her wound has stopped bleeding almost immediately. Caitlyn refocuses on finding Jinx, the name given to Vi by Sevika. She leans against a support beam, but quickly stands up straight as the entire tower creaks unsteadily. She notices that the beam is marked with various heights labeled "Violet" and "Powder," realizing that Vi used to live here. She asks who Powder is, and Vi explains that it's her sister whom she needs to find. The conversation leads to Vi revealing that her parents were killed by enforcers.

Vi.
-Easy, easy, easy.
We need you back on your feet.
What was the name Sevika gave you? Jinx? Right.
Jinx.
How could I forget? We're going to have to be more careful now.
-Silco will be watching You used to live here? Who's Powder? My sister.
I thought she died, but, no.
I have to try and find her.
How do you not know if your sister is alive or dead? It's hard to check up on people from inside a concrete cell.
What, you don't have parents? No! They were killed by enforcers.

A commotion stirs, prompting Vi and Caitlyn to follow the noise outside. Silco is standing there with his thugs, holding vials of shimmer over a small crowd of vagrants. He drops the vials, leading the addicts to imbibe the drug voraciously. They begin to transform, marching towards Vi mindlessly. Caitlyn starts pushing on the support beam in an attempt to bring the water tower down. Vi promises to save her sister and destroy Silco's empire, turning to slam her fist into the beam, finally beginning the tower's collapse.

Vander's prodigy.
I've regretted that we never had the opportunity to speak.
What have you done with my sister? -I've freed her.
Candidly, I thought you were the prize of your secondhand family.
But Jinx... Oh.
She is more than I ever imagined.
I'm gonna find her and erase whatever fucked-up delusions you put in her head.
But first, I'm gonna bring your bullshit empire down all around you.
You don't know your limits, girl.
It's what got Vander killed.
What drove your sister away.
And it's why I'm here right now.
-Yeah, well... You talk too much.

----------------

## Jinx (cut or integrate into Vi's perspective?)

From atop a distant tower in Zaun, Jinx holds the flare that Vi gave her when she was a child. She ignites it, sending blue smoke skyward, determined to attract Vi's attention.

Wherever you are, light it up and I'll find you.

----------------

## Caitlyn

Vi and Caitlyn escape in the chaos as the water tower falls apart. Enraged, Silco sends his henchmen after them and kicks Huck into the dirt until he stops moving. Vi and Caitlyn reenter the city proper, and Vi spots Jinx's plume of smoke.

----------------

## Marcus (integrate into Vi's perspective?)

Marcus erects a blockade upon every bridge between Piltover and Zaun, illuminated by floodlights, with the intent of searching all who pass.

----------------

## Viktor

Back in Viktor's childhood, the boy arrives at Singed's lab with a crate full of flowers to feed Rio. However, he finds Rio in severe pain, flailing on the ground, her body hooked up to a series of tubes. He embraces Rio in empathy, horrified at what Singed has done. Singed says he "thought [Viktor] understood," and that the mutation must survive. Disgusted, Viktor absconds, trampling over the flowers as he goes.

Rio will live.
You did this? I thought you understood.
The mutation must survive.

Returning once more to the present day, Singed has contained Rio within a massive glass jar full of green liquid, her unmoving body still connected to various tubes. An adult Viktor limps into Singed's lab, saying, "I understand now." Singed turns to face him, his visage scarred and burnt by the fire set by Powder all those years ago.

----------------

## Silco

Silco retreats to his office, venting about how many problems "one girl" can cause. He sees a dagger stuck in his desk: on it, an arrow pointing upward, drawn in crayon. He looks up. Dangling from the ceiling is Sevika's unconscious body, vandalized with crude graffiti, including the word "liar" numerous times.

How many problems can one girl cause?

----------------

## Vi

Eventually, Jinx's flare burns out, prompting her to angrily throw it to the ground below as she examines her stolen hex crystal. Finally, Vi arrives. Reunited at last, the sisters embrace in tears. The crystal slips from Jinx's grasp and clatters to the floor. She tells Vi that she's changed since Vi left, but Vi assures her that she still loves her deeply.

Powder? -Vi? Oh, Powder! I'm so sorry, Powder.
I... I tried to come back.
I promise, I did.
But I... I got arrested.
Marcus? I don't know.
Iâ¦ It doesn't matter.
I justâ¦ I never thought I'd see you again.
Are you real? Yes, of course.
It's me, Vi, your sister.
I'm here.
I'm right here.
Things changed when you left.
I changed.
I know, Pow-pow, I know.
You did what you had to do to survive.
Me too.
It's okay.
What matters is we're together.

Caitlyn catches up a moment later, prompting Jinx to draw her gun, pointed at Caitlyn. Jinx realizes that Sevika wasn't lying about Vi being with an enforcer, while Caitlyn sees the crystal and realizes that Vi's sister is Jinx. Vi attempts to calm both parties down, but Jinx becomes hostile, surmising that Vi is playing a cruel trick. Vi continuously refers to her sister as Powder, causing her to angrily assert that her name is Jinx now. She accuses Vi of manipulating her in order to obtain the hex crystal, but Vi insists she doesn't even recognize the gemstone. Jinx hears a strange noise in the distance, and suddenly, the Firelights appear.

Who's she? Who are you? -It's okay.
She's a friend.
Sevika wasn't lying? You're with an enforcer? Your sister is Jinx? Caitlyn, just listen, we can work this out.
This is a trick! You're playing me! Shut up! I'm in no mood.
We didn't say anything.
I wasn't talking to you! Powder, it's okay.
Stop calling me that.
It's Jinx now.
Powder fell down a well.
You're not a jinx.
- God, I never should have - Stop talking to me like I'm a child! Was that why you came? For this stupid stone? No, I don't even know what that is, Iâ¦ You're a class act, Sister.
Sister.
Thought I missed her.
Bet you wouldn't miss her.
Powder! I'm here for you.
Only you.
You can fire that thing if you want, but I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going to abandon you again.
-Everyone, shut up, I need to think.
Do you hear that? -Powder.
-Powder! -Take her.
Vi? No!

Jinx opens fire on the masked hoverboarders, with Vi covering her back and fighting to fend them off. Caitlyn seizes the hex crystal before it can roll off the tower, but is then knocked unconscious by a Firelight. As the battle continues, Vi is disturbed at how unhinged and violent her sister has become, and while Vi is distracted, a Firelight knocks her out as well. Another Firelight slashes at Jinx's leg, leaving a gash. Finally, the gangsters deploy a smoke bomb and disappear with Caitlyn and Vi. Having lost her sister once again, Jinx cries out in agony.

----------------

## Caitlyn

Caitlyn and Vi wake up handcuffed to metal pipes and blinded by burlap sacks over their heads. They argue briefly until someone enters the room and takes Vi away, leaving Caitlyn alone.

One of the Firelights removes the sack from Vi's head and leaves her alone with the gang's leader. The leader removes his mask, revealing himself to be Ekko Ekko. Ekko explains that he thought Vi was dead and begins to question her, still unsure if he can trust her. Vi is adamant that she knows nothing about the hextech gemstone and that she isn't working for Silco Silco. Eventually, she shirks off her handcuffs and embraces Ekko in a hug, saying that she missed him. After a moment, Ekko reciprocates, shedding a single tear as he does.

After examining Viktor's Viktor's research, Singed Singed offers him a vial containing a variant of Shimmer, which he claims will allow him to survive a "violent transition." However, he warns Viktor that taking this path will cause the Topsiders to despise him, revealing that he parted ways with Heimerdinger Heimerdinger for similar reasons. Viktor takes the shimmer, telling himself that Jayce Jayce will understand.

Jayce is hard at work at the forge when Mel Mel approaches him. He shows her the grenade given to him by Marcus Marcus, showing disbelief at the quality of its engineering. He also expresses guilt for having betrayed his former mentor, Heimerdinger, but Mel assures him that he did the right thing.

Sevika Sevika informs Silco that Marcus has shut down the border between Piltover and Zaun, and that the Chem-Barons have called for an assembly. Silco says he needs to find Jinx Jinx, but Sevika suggests that she'll reappear "when she's ready."

Jinx returns to her workshop and begins stitching the gash in her leg while arguing with the voice of Mylo in her head. Mylo berates her, but Jinx tries to stay positive, telling herself that Vi came back for her, not the crystal.

Ekko introduces Vi to his new home: a small, sequestered settlement centered around a massive tree (a rare sight in Zaun). He explains that the settlement has become a refuge for victims of Shimmer. He shows Vi a large, painted mural commemorating their dead. It prominently features Violet Violet, Powder Powder, Mylo Mylo, Claggor Claggor, Vander Vander, Benzo Benzo, and numerous others. Someone is in the process of adding the pink-haired girl that reminded Jinx of Violet. Ekko tries to convince Vi that Powder is gone and that Jinx can't be saved, but Vi refuses to give up on her sister.

A riot has broken out at the border, with enforcers struggling to hold the line. Viktor sits on the Piltover Crest icon Piltover side, and Jayce arrives on Marcus's notice. Jayce admonishes Viktor for the optics of his own partner violating the blockade, but Viktor is baffled that Jayce is the one who ordered it. Viktor explains that he was visiting Zaun in search of someone he knew who could help save his life. Jayce asserts that people from the undercity are dangerous, but Viktor angrily reminds him that he's from the undercity. He also lies, saying that "this friend of [his]" was unable to offer any assistance.

The Chem-Barons hold their assembly: Finn Finn, Smeech Smeech, Chross Chross, Renni Renni, and Margot Margot. Finn bemoans that with the border shut down, the Barons are bleeding money, and he decries Silco for "losing control." Finally, Silco arrives with Sevika. Finn and the others question him, suggesting that they cut a deal with Topsiders and return the gemstone. In response, Sevika dons a gas mask, turns off the ceiling fan, and drops a metal tank which begins filling the room with an invisible gas. The other Barons begin coughing and choking, but Silco seems immune to its effects as he distributes gas masks to everyone except Finn. He lectures the Barons, reminding them that the undercity had nothing before he "gave them a taste of Topside." Eventually, Finn collapses on the floor, begging Silco for the final mask. Silco takes a deep breath through the mask before finally bequeathing it to Finn. At last, Sevika restarts the ceiling fan and swings the doors open, airing out the room. Having made his point, Silco takes his leave.

Elora Elora brings a letter to Mel, and Mel instantly recognizes the binding wax seal as her Medarda Clan Crest icon family crest.

A masked child removes Caitlyn's restraints and offers her a bowl of water, but she swats it from the child's hand. Ekko, sitting in the doorway, dismisses the child. Caitlyn begins to negotiate for Vi's release, but Vi appears behind Ekko, free and unharmed. Ekko explains that Vi has vouched for Caitlyn, and so he'll allow her to return to Piltover.

Jinx reappears before Silco, seizing the device he uses to inject Shimmer into his damaged eye. She confronts him for lying about Vi, using the needle to create tiny stab wounds across his face. Silco claims he only wanted to protect Jinx, accusing Vi of returning only for the crystal, not for her sister. He reminds Jinx that he found her and gave her a home after Vi left her. Visibly distressed, Jinx finally uses the device for its intended purposes, injecting Silco's eye with Shimmer and storming out of the room.

Ekko and Caitlyn get into a heated argument. Ekko claims that Silco pays the Piltover Police Crest Enforcers to hunt his people "like animals," but Caitlyn doesn't believe it. He confronts her about the gemstone, and she explains its purpose: that it can be used to build any hextech device. Ekko wants to use it to fight back against Silco, but Caitlyn believes she can bring an end to the conflict if she can present the crystal to Jayce and the Council. After some convincing, Ekko agrees on one condition: that he deliver the crystal himself.

Viktor carefully dismantles Jinx's grenade. Mel theorizes that someone in Zaun may be weaponizing hextech and suggests that Jayce and Viktor build their own weapons. Viktor passionately rejects the idea, arguing that they invented hextech to improve lives, not to take them. Jayce, however, is conflicted. In his distress, Viktor nearly sets off the grenade, but cuts a wire and deactivates it.

Heimerdinger Heimerdinger dons a cloak and sails across the river to Zaun.

Ekko says his goodbyes to the Firelights and leaves along with Vi and Caitlyn. They see a swarm of insects which glow with an eerie green light. Vi tells Caitlyn, who has never seen them before, that the creatures are called "Firelights."

Jayce discovers a drawing he made as a child, depicting himself as a hero wielding a large mechanical hammer. He hugs his mother, lamenting that he may have to do something he never thought he would.

Viktor retrieves the vial of Shimmer he received from Singed, hidden in the handle of his crutch. He carves runes into his leg brace as well as his own skin. Finally, he injects himself with the drug and cuts open his hand, feeding his blood to the hex core. He screams in pain as Shimmer and magic infuse into his bloodstream, beginning a violent transition.

Ekko, Vi, and Caitlyn begin to cross the Bridge of Progress back to Piltover, but Vi stops. She says that she needs to go back for her sister, and leaves Ekko and Caitlyn to go ahead without her. Jinx is perched high upon the bridge's supports, watching them with great interest through a spyglass.

Ekko and Caitlyn encounter the blockade, Enforcers commanding them to halt. Caitlyn sees Marcus and flashes her badge, saying she has proof that Silco is behind everything. Not seeing any other option, Ekko brandishes the canister containing the gemstone. Marcus steps forward and shoots Ekko in the torso, training his pistol on Caitlyn and picking up the canister as the boy collapses. Hearing the gunshot, Vi doubles back to rejoin her friends. Marcus seems to struggle internally, knowing he needs to kill Caitlyn to protect himself, but appearing unable to do so. Mysteriously, a swarm of firelights descends on the scene. Closer inspection reveals that the insects are mechanical replicas, and without warning, they explode, wreaking havoc on the blockade.

Jinx arrives in the wake of the false firelights, which were apparently by her design. With her shock pistol, she executes a struggling enforcer. Many others lay dead. Caitlyn attempts to stand, but her leg is wounded. Marcus begins to speak and dies mid-sentence. Vi rushes to Caitlyn's side and helps her to her feet. Jinx retrieves the canister and slings it over her shoulder. Upon seeing Vi and Caitlyn, she is enraged, believing Caitlyn to be a corrupting influence bent on turning Vi against her. She fires Pow-Pow at the pair, forcing them to jump out of the way.

Ekko appears on his hoverboard, having survived Marcus's shot via a metal plate hidden under his clothes. He knocks the minigun out of Jinx's hands and steals back the canister, throwing it to Vi and Caitlyn and telling them to go. Reluctantly, the pair shuffle away, leaving Ekko behind to fight Jinx. Jinx fires her shock pistol, but Ekko remembers a game he played with Powder when they were kids, and uses it to predict and dodge Jinx's shots. He tackles her, pins her to the ground, and beats her viciously. However, seeing Jinx's bloodied nose and frightened expression causes him to momentarily hesitate, taking pity on the girl he once knew. Jinx takes the opportunity to pull a grenade's pin. Both of them are engulfed in the resulting explosion.

I knew it was a mistake trusting you.
You've been a real picnic yourself.
I'm not the one who walked us into, not one, but two of Silco's traps.
-This isn't Silco, it's someone else.
How do you know? 'Cause we'd already be dead.
Oh, very nice.
When were you planning to tell me that your lunatic sister works for him? Just as soon as you came clean about what the hell you're really doing down here.
-I told you the truth.
-Bullshit.
What was that glowing stone? That's what I thought.
What's going on? -Hey, stop! Get your hands off of me! -Leave her alone! -Let me go! -Vi? Vi! Vi! Hey.
You shy? Or just ugly? You look good for a dead girl.
Ekko? What do you know about this? Nothing.
What the hell is this all about? What were you doing with Jinx? Her name is Powder.
And I just found her when you and your goons showed up.
It's me.
Vi.
Same person who used to take you down to the junk heap and hose you down when you got covered in grease.
That was a long time ago.
People change.
Yeah.
I'm getting that.
Are you working for Silco? Fuck.
You.
I thought you were dead.
Now you show up with a Piltie and give her a tour of the Lanes? You were following us? Why didn't you say something? I didn't know if I could trust you.
Soâ¦ so you just come out swinging? Gee, I wonder who I learned that from? Ah, well, you shoulda learned more.
You still punch like a little boy.
And you still block with your face.
I remember when you wouldn't stand up to me.
I missed you, little man.
How long have you had those off? How long have you been whining? Hmm.
Fascinating.
I would very much like to see the device.
This, uh, Hexcore.
That may be difficult to arrange.
I've tried every combination of runes, butâ¦ it's always the same.
The subject, wither and rot.
Uh, perhaps the error resides not with your calculations butâ¦ with your subjects.
Nature has made us intolerant to change, but fortunately, we have the capacity to change our nature.
-And this isâ¦ Shimmer? -A variant.
It should provide everything one needs to survive a violent transition.
Will it work on plants? You aren't here about the plants, are you? I know the look of a doomed man.
I must warn you.
If you take this path, they will despise you.
Love and legacy are the sacrifices we make for progress.
It's why I parted ways with Heimerdinger.
-Jayce will understand.
-Perhaps.
Hammer work is such a delicate art.
How'd you find me? You're the de facto head of the Council.
People notice where you go.
Huh.
Don't remind me.
This border shutdown has people agitated.
They should be.
Marcus brought this to me.
It's an explosive.
I tried taking it apart and it nearly killed me.
Whoever built it knows exactly what they're doing.
This and Shimmer.
It's hard to believe what they're capable of.
Is that what's really bothering you? He was my mentor, Mel.
And I betrayed him.
Everything you said about him was true.
My family cast me out and yet, part of me still loves them.
Heimerdinger will understand eventually.
It's your time now, Jayce.
No more red tape.
You can bring Hextech to the masses, just like you've always dreamed.
Hmm.
First, I have to save Viktor.
Where is he? I don't know.
He disappeared.
He does that sometimes.
-No sign of Caitlyn either.
-The Kiramman girl? It's justâ¦ -Uh, never mind.
-Hey.
We'll get through this.
I'll stall the Council but they'll soon need their leader.
In the meantimeâ¦ Try not to lose your nuts.
All our business is down.
Enforcers are searching anyone who crosses the bridge.
Marcus is following my orders.
Preventing Vi and Caitlyn from returning.
Or he's finally flipped.
Hmm.
The chembarons scheduled an assembly.
Oh.
-I've had enough headaches.
-It didn't sound like a request.
-Where are you going? I need to find Jinx.
-Sir.
-What? I got more in common with cave lice than Jinx.
But let's just say I didn't always see eye-to-eye with my old man.
And? She'll come to you when she's ready.
Hmm.
-You lost her.
I didn't lose her! They took her.
She cares about that enforcer, you saw it.
She was there for me! Not the enforcer.
Remember her name? Why would I remember her name? Well, she's just some stupid topsider! Caitlyn.
Pow.
Come on.
Go! I got it.
Whoo-hoo! Is that real tree? Pretty cool, huh? When I first saw it, I knew this was the place.
If a single seed could make it down here, so could we.
You built all this? Not alone.
-After Vanderâ¦ â¦died, Silco flooded the lanes with Shimmer.
He didn't care what it did to people.
Everyone here was an addict or a victim.
Hi.
They needed somewhere safe to start again.
I should have been there.
For you.
For everyone.
That's a good way to drive yourself crazy.
If I just went with you that day, maybe none of this would have happened.
Or maybe you'd be dead.
Orâ¦ changed.
Powder's gone, Vi.
All that's left is Jinx and she belongs to Silco.
You're wrong.
She's still in there.
I can reach her.
You can't.
I know my sister.
I got one more thing to show you.
This is everyone we've lost.
The price of our freedom.
Some of it was Enforcers.
Most was Silco.
Your sister works for him not because she has to, but because she wants to.
I'm sorry, but that's who she is now.
Get down! -Let us through! -Come on! We understand.
Just stand down! -Thank you for alerting me, Sheriff.
-Not a problem, Councilor.
Jayce, what is this? Do you have any idea how this looks? I order a blockade and my own partner violates it? You ordered this? Why? There are people down there who seem hell-bent on destroying us.
What were you doing? I was consulting a friend about our quandary.
I told you, I knew someone.
Well, you didn't say they were from the undercity.
What difference does that make? What diffâ¦ They're dangerous.
I'm from the undercity.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I've had a lot on my plate.
Was your friend able to help? No.
No, he said, "Nature was resistant to this sort of tampering.
" All right, we'll keep at it.
First, this wild attack in the heart of Piltover.
Now, the border's closing.
We're bleeding money and for what? His dreams of rebellion? He's losing control.
If we stand togetherâ¦ We aren't due for an assembly.
We should be.
Ever since your stunt topside, profits have been plummeting.
He's right.
Merchandise is frozen at the border.
Topsiders are too afraid to cross.
We're all wondering, what's your plan to fix this? You're all wondering, are you? Way I see it, we should cut a deal and give back the Gemstone.
Better to have some trade than none at all.
The border issue is temporary.
Jinx will deal with it.
Huh.
Rumor is, your dog's off her leash.
How you meant to bring Piltover to heel if you can't handle your own people, huh? What's that? Oh, you don't recognize it? Have you forgotten where we came from? The mines they had us in? -Air so thick it clogged your throat.
-Stuck in your eyes.
But I pulled you all up from the depths.
-Offered you a taste of topside.
And fresh air.
I gave you life.
Purpose.
But you've grown fat and complacent.
Too much time in the sun.
We came from a world where there was never enough to go around, Finn.
That is why we fight.
Do you remember? Sorry.
Please.
Please.
Don't forget again.
Good meeting.
I've had word from our friends overseas.
This threat from the undercity is drawing attention.
Piltover looks vulnerable.
It's too soon.
Jayce isn't ready.
There's one other thing.
This arrived for you.
-Hmm? What have you done with Vi? Listen, let her go.
I brought her here.
It's me you want.
-My hero.
-You'reâ¦ But I thought youâ¦ I thought they were hurting you! Vi tells me I can trust you.
You get a pass back topside, that's it.
Let's go.
Let me help you with that.
Where've you been, Jinx? Oh, you know.
Here, there, chasing down dead ends.
And guess what? They're not all dead.
I can explain.
-Don't move, silly.
I might hurt you.
I didn't know.
Marcus never told me she was in Stillwater.
-But you found out she came back.
-You lied.
-I wanted to protect you.
-From what? She and the enforcer are back for the crystal.
Not for you.
-Have you forgotten how she left you? Who found you? Who cared for you? Gave you a home? I am your family.
Everyone else betrays us.
-I need you.
-Now more than ever.
You have to complete the weapon.
It's beautiful.
If your people had your way, it'd be rubble and ash.
It's a misunderstanding.
They think you work for Silco.
Your people hunt us like animals.
Silco pays them to do it.
That's not possible.
You're wrong.
Say that one more time.
Ekko, she believes what she's saying, okay? She's not your enemy.
Oh, yeah? Then what's this? You got it.
You have to let me take that back.
- -What is it? It's a Gemstone.
It was stolen during the attack.
By your sister.
You just forgot to mention that? With this, someone with the right knowledge could buildâ¦ any Hextech device.
If enforcers are becoming moreâ¦ aggressive, that's why.
We could beat Silco with this.
That won't solve things.
Easy for you to say.
Your people aren't dying all around you.
Ekko, it's wrong what's been done to you.
You'd be well within your rights to keep it.
I couldn't blame you.
Butâ¦ if you do, this cycle of violence will never stop.
This is our best shot at setting the record straight.
This city needs healing.
More than I ever realized.
Please, let me help you.
You got a plan? I have a friend on the council.
Let me take the Gemstone to him.
He'll listen to me.
Your people wouldn't have to hide anymore.
One condition.
I'm the one who gives it to them.
Um, the form is crude, butâ¦ uh, the engineering isâ¦ inspired.
You think they could crack Hextech? Mm.
It's a leap.
It's been suggested that they may have found a way to utilize the Gemstone.
If we are to assume the worst, that would mean they've turned it into a weapon.
Well, do we know this for certain? We can't afford to wait to find out.
Wait.
What are you suggesting? We should prepare our own countermeasures.
You want us to build weapons? Absolutely not.
That is not why we invented Hextech.
We would shatter any attempt at peace.
-Heimerdinger would never go for this.
-Heimerdingers' inaction is what brought us here.
You said so yourself.
The peace is already broken, Jayce.
I'm only asking you to prepare to defend your people.
If we're lucky, we'll never need to use it.
The decision is yours.
Ridiculous.
You cannot be considering this.
What if she's right? Are we just gonna stand by while they attack us? We're scientists, not soldiers.
We have the knowledge to defend ourselves.
We agreed Hextech was to improve livesâ¦ â¦not to take them.
We may not have a choice.
There is always a choice.
I need to think.
What are they? We call them firelights.
Never seen so many though.
I'm worried I have to do something I never thought I would.
Vi? I can't leave her again.
You can't change her.
I have to try.
Don't get yourself killed.
No promises.
It's been real, Cupcake.
Thanks.
For everything.
-Shut up.
It's just a goodbye hug.
She wouldn't do that.
Not again.
-Halt! What the hell is this? Sir! I have proof.
Silco's behind everything.
Show me.
No.
Hmm.
Shit.
Caitlyn! Liar.
I told you to leave this alone.
Tell myâ¦ Tell my daughter Iâ¦ Go! Oh, look who it is.
The boy savior.
Hah.
Yes! No.

We flash back to a scene from Mel's Mel's childhood. She stands amidst the wreckage of a crumbling throne room. Her mother, Ambessa Ambessa, joins Mel in the room and begins lecturing her, extolling the virtues of war. Moments later, two Noxus Crest icon Noxian guards enter, escorting a young woman as their prisoner, apparently a member of the newly dismantled royalty. Mel encourages her mother to show mercy, but Ambessa beheads the prisoner with one swipe of her blade.

Back in the present day, Mel awakes from the apparent dream, startled by the painful memory. Above her bed is a large painting of the prisoner's necklace on the ground and covered in blood. She sees Jayce Jayce next to her, still asleep.

Caitlyn Caitlyn and Vi Vi make their way back into Piltover Crest icon Piltover, evading squads of enforcers as the police rush to the Bridge of Progress. Caitlyn opens the canister and realizes that the hex crystal is missing.

Silco Silco arrives at the bridge sees Jinx's Jinx's body lying amongst the wreckage. He rushes to her side, finding the hex crystal in her limp hand. He carries her back to Zaun Crest icon Zaun.

That morning, Jayce and Mel arrive at the Bridge of Progress. Upon seeing the enforcers' many corpses, Jayce vomits into the water below. While bent down, he sees the remnants of one of the mechanical firelights.

Vi and Caitlyn sneak into the latter's bedroom through the window. Mrs Mrs. Kiramman kicks the door down, pointing a rifle at the pair as if she were expecting intruders, but is surprised to find Caitlyn instead. Mr Mr. Kiramman embraces his daughter, relieved to see her safe. Mrs. Kiramman asks to speak to Caitlyn in private.

Mr. Kiramman begins to remove the shrapnel from Caitlyn's leg. Mrs. Kiramman reprimands Caitlyn for her recklessness, but Caitlyn admonishes her mother, a councilor, for her role in creating the squalid conditions she witnessed in Zaun. After some convincing, Mrs. Kiramman agrees to allow Caitlyn and Vi to make their case before the Council.

Silco bursts into Singed's Singed's lab carrying Jinx, still unconscious, and they strap her down to an operating table. Singed claims that he can save her, but that the process will be "demanding." Silco assures him that Jinx can handle it, and implores him not to let her die. Singed surprises Silco with a syringe to the neck, anesthetizing Silco for the sake of his "sanity." As Silco fades, Singed claims that he too once had a daughter.

Sevika Sevika is sitting alone in The Last Drop, drinking and repairing her prosthetic arm. Finn Finn sits across from her and strikes up a conversation. He expresses disappointment in Silco's performance and asks her to consider turning against him. Sevika is resistant to the idea, but Finn leaves her to think about it.

Ambessa arrives in Piltover on a Noxian ship, accompanied by a host of soldiers. Mel and Elora Elora meet her as she deboards. Ambessa attempts to frame her arrival as an innocent family visit, but Mel is suspicious of her mother and still harbors anger since Ambessa banished her over a decade prior. Ambessa informs her that Mel's brother, Kino, is dead, having "crossed the wrong man." She reveals her ulterior motive: she wants her hands on hextech weaponry, but Mel refuses to oblige. A young male young male escort arrives, and Ambessa departs at his side.

Caitlyn returns to her bedroom, where Vi had been waiting, and informs her that they'll present their case to Council that night. Vi laments on how badly she misses her younger sister and expresses regret for failing her, while Caitlyn simply listens intently.

Jinx wakes up in Singed's lab, wracked by incredible pain. Singed injects her with shimmer, and Jinx begins to see vivid hallucinations of Vi, herself, and Caitlyn. In the visions, Vi betrays Jinx and replaces her with Caitlyn. Singed remarks that the pain will only get worse, and Jinx conflates him with the image of Caitlyn. She screams in agony.

Later, Silco, comes to his senses. He groggily examines Jinx's operation table: the girl is gone, but the table is still covered in dirt and blood. He holds a scalpel to Singed's neck, asking what he did to her. Singed replies that he saved her life.

A cloaked Heimerdinger Heimerdinger walks through the streets of Zaun, taking in the depth of the city's poverty and violence. A young child approaches and gives him a handful of nuts and bolts as a gift. Hoping to impress her, Heimerdinger performs a sleight-of-hand trick to "magically" replace the scrap metal with a spinning top. However, the girl's mother angrily takes her away from the stranger.

He returns to the Bridge of Progress and discovers Ekko's Ekko's hoverboard on the ground, remarking on its "ingenious" design. Ekko is sitting against the bridge's supports, clutching an injured leg. He recognizes Heimerdinger, asking what he's doing on this side of the bridge. Heimerdinger bemoans that after losing his councilorship, he wanted to offer Zaun his assistance, but that he's "not welcome." Ekko laughs, saying that he's having the exact same day. Heimerdinger tells Ekko that his wounds look serious and that he requires medical attention. Ekko replies that the professor is holding his ride.

Jayce meets Ambessa, who is enjoying a hot bath at a bathhouse. She strongly encourages him to build hextech weaponry. Though he is initially dismissive of her advice, she seems to convince him of the real dangers posed by the undercity, and implores him to listen to the experience she has gained through age.

The Council convenes, processing the revelation that Marcus Marcus had been secretly working against them. Caitlyn and Vi arrive, informing the Council that Silco is behind everything and is working to achieve Zaun's independence. Jayce presents Jinx's grenade, asking who created it. Caitlyn hesitates, but Vi admits it was made by Jinx. Jayce proposes the use of force, but the other councilors are unwilling to start a war until all diplomatic avenues have been exhausted. Vi angrily asserts that there can be no diplomacy with Silco, but the Council is unwilling to listen, prompting Vi to storm out of the room. She walks out into the rain, but Caitlyn tries to stop her. Vi insists that their efforts to reach the Council have failed and that she was naive to think things could change, but Caitlyn believes there must be another way. Vi compares Piltover and Zaun to "oil and water," saying her relationship with Caitlyn is the same. She tells Caitlyn to forget about her, and walks away.

Viktor Viktor stands at the docks and lets his crutch clatter to the ground. His bad leg has been completely transmuted into a purple metal. He begins to walk, and though he nearly stumbles, he breaks into a run, something he'd never been able to do before.

Back at his lab, Viktor prepares to continue transmuting himself into metal, carving runes all across his body. Meanwhile, Sky is approaching, nervously rehearsing ways to ask Viktor to take a look at a project she'd been working on. Once again, Viktor attempts to inject himself with shimmer but after examining the vial, he realizes he's run out of shimmer. Viktor slices his hand open, feeding his blood to the hex core, and attempts to go through with the procedure anyways. Sky Sky walks in on him shrieking in pain as the hex core violently transforms his flesh. She rushes to his side, attempting to pull him away, but the magic of the hex core disintegrates her into ash. Viktor faints.

He wakes up a short time later, only his hand having been transmuted. He sees that Sky has become a pile of dust on the ground, and is heartbroken. In addition, the hex core has taken on a fleshier, more organic appearance.

Jayce begins forging a hextech weapon: what will eventually become the Mercury Hammer Mercury Hammer. Vi appears unannounced, and Jayce threatens to have her arrested. She berates him for his readiness to throw strangers into a criminal justice system whose consequences he doesn't fully understand. However, they agree that they both want to make Silco pay. Vi dons one of the Atlas gauntlets Atlas gauntlets; despite being designed for mining, she seems to reckon that they would make decent weapons, likening them to Vander's Vander's gauntlets. She suggests that they go against the Council's wishes and attack Silco's shimmer manufacturing facilities.

Later, a squad of enforcers helmed by Jayce (now wielding the finished Mercury Hammer) board a train carrying numerous barrels of shimmer and force it back to its station. The enforcers quickly take control of the production facility and begin arresting workers, many of whom are children. One red-haired boy escapes an enforcer and presses a button triggering the alarm, waking up a squad of chemtanks: people in full-body mech-suits enhanced by shimmer. The chemtanks begin killing enforcers with superhuman speed and strength, eventually surrounding Jayce. Vi appears, wearing Atlas gauntlets on both hands, and destroys a chemtank with one massive punch. Together, they begin dispatching the remaining chemtanks. Jayce switches into cannon stance cannon stance and fires furiously, but in his fervor, he mistakenly strikes the red-haired boy. The child falls over a railing and plummets to the ground. A short time later, Jayce and Vi find the boy just in time to watch him die.

Caitlyn takes a shower, seemingly unable to take her thoughts away from Vi. Eventually, she emerges into the bathroom. Looking into the large, foggy mirror, she slowly realizes that someone has scribbled Jinx's trademark monkey symbol into the condensation. In the reflection, she sees that Jinx—eyes now pink from the effects of shimmer— Jinx—eyes now pink from the effects of shimmer— is standing behind her.

When I was ten, your grandfather brought me to the aftermath of the Battle of Hildenard.
He offered me a gold coin for every blade I retrieved from the fallen.
Said we needed the steel.
But I knew it was a lie.
He wanted me to know death.
Kino says war is a failure of statecraft.
Your brother thinks he can talk his way out of anything.
He fancies himself a fox among the wolves.
But mark me, child, if you want to last in this world, you must learn to be both the fox and the wolf.
We'll paint the walls in gold.
Import crystal chandeliers.
Advisors will enter here, but the regent will have her own, secret entrance.
She should have a kind, fat face.
Clever, to charm her subjects, but pliable so we can mold her.
Perhaps, she could be my daughter.
You'd give me a throne? I will give you the world, child, if you prove you can take it.
What should we do with her? She won't make trouble for us.
Strip her of her possessions and send her to the far colonies.
-She's a symbol of the old regime.
Kill her now, and only one must die.
Let her live and you may need to kill thousands.
We can show the people we are merciful.
A wolf has no mercy.
-Will you be okay? -I'll be right back.
-Okay.
Jinx! It's gone.
What? It was all for nothing.
Sir, we've secured the area.
I've got orders to escort you back into the city.
Sir? Are you all right? Who lives here? Another Councilor friend of yours? Caitlyn! Oh.
We were so worried.
Thank goodness you're safe! And you found a stray.
This is Vi.
She's from the undercity.
So I see.
Could we have a word, Caitlyn? In private.
You have to speak to the Council.
Speak to the Council? You understand you've broken several laws? She was doing what she thought was right.
I'll take responsibility.
You're a Councilor's daughter.
Your actions reflect on the entire body.
My actions? You know what else reflects on the Council? Its citizens living on the streets.
Being poisoned.
Having to choose between a kingpin who wants to exploit them and a government that doesn't give a shit.
-Caitlyn! I'm sure our daughter could use some rest after her adventures.
-I'll schedule an audience.
Thank you.
You and your friend can address the Council yourselves.
I'd suggest you prepare accordingly.
-Her injuries are severe.
-You think I can't see that? Huh.
I believe I can save her, but the process will be demanding.
-Sometimes death is a mercy.
She can take it.
And before I begin, I must knowâ¦ Are you prepared to lose her? -Jinx? -Jinx! She won't die, Doctor.
She can't.
I understand.
Please understand, this is for your own sanity.
I, too, once had a daughter.
Silco isn't taking guests.
Not a problem.
Wasn't here for him.
Thought I might bend your ear.
You know when I ask my mates what Silco's up to, your name's first out of their mouths.
"Sevika's out in the harbor," or "Sevika paid the knuckleheads a visit.
" You're a scary lady.
Get to your point.
Run a tight ship, don't you? Except it's not your ship.
It's his and Jinx's.
This is your plan? Undermine Silco by making a half-assed play at my ego? Gotta hand it to you, Finn.
Every time I think you can't get dumber, you dig a new low.
Let's be plain, then.
He's slipping.
The undercity's devolving to chaos.
And somehow, I get the feeling he isn't up there balancing booksheets.
Jinx gets a whim, suddenly his spine's made of jelly.
And here you are, shoveling his shit.
Ego is one thing, brain's another.
You aren't the only one dissatisfied with his performance.
There's bigger fish than Silco.
Mel.
Elora.
You didn't have to come out to meet me.
-What are you doing here, Mother? -Can I not visit? I've heard stories of Piltover's hospitality.
You didn't sail halfway across the continent to sample the local cuisine.
-It's been over a decade, Mel.
-Since you banished me? Such drama.
I sent you here to oversee our family's interests and grow yourself.
Which you have.
You said, "Perhaps, your sentimentality will be more at home with those soft-spined idealists overseas.
" You have your father's memory.
Don't try to ingratiate yourself with me.
-Mel.
-Or that.
Your brother's gone.
What happened? He crossed the wrong man.
I was distracted.
That's a mistake I can't take back.
Your Jayce Talis has turned his eye to Hextech weaponry.
I knew it.
War is coming.
You've let the problems of your undercity fester too long.
Piltover isn't like Noxus.
War isn't our first and every recourse.
I sponsored Hextech to protect the city, not burn it to the ground.
It's not conjecture, it's a fact.
Weapons can't be unmade and they are always used.
I'm here to help guide you to the right decisions.
-I don't need your guidance.
-We'll see.
Miss Medarda? -Yes? -Yes? He's for me, dear.
I'm off to sample the local cuisine.
We'll present our case to the Council tonight.
You did all this yourself? Without even going down there? And I thought Powder could get obsessed.
What happened to her, it's not your fault.
When my parents were still aliveâ¦ me and Powder used to share a bed like this.
Except, maybe, half the size.
We played a game where we pretended to be bigger and bigger monsters.
So she would say, "I'm a slug monster with venom for ooze.
" And I'd say, "Well, I'm a slug-eating crab with razor spikes.
" Sometimes, Iâ¦ I'd get carried away and she'd get scared.
I didn't want her to start crying and wake my parents up, soâ¦ I pretended to chase my own monsters away.
I'd sayâ¦ "No monster's gonna get you when I'm here.
" Then a real monster showed up.
And I just ran away.
I left her.
You know, Powder, you're stronger than you think.
Vi? I'm so sorry, Powder.
-Your sister is jinx.
-No! Jinx.
No, no.
No! I understand this must be painful.
No! -I'm afraid it will only get worse.
-Wait! No! What have you done? I saved her life.
Hey, watch it, furball.
Move.
Oh.
Hmm.
-Hmm.
Huh? Hmmâ¦ Like this.
Get away from her.
Byeâ¦ Oh, ingenious.
Though these blades seem improperly pitched.
You're wrong.
It's designed for the fissures.
The air is denser.
Oh.
-Are you all right, lad? Yeah, I'm fine, I just sprained my ankle.
Are you Councilor Heimerdinger? It's just Heimerdinger now.
What are you doing on this side of the river? I wanted to offer my assistance to the citizens of the undercity, butâ¦ it seems I'm unwelcome.
-What is it? -We're having the exact same day.
That looks like more than a sprain.
You need medical attention.
I have to get home.
It isn't safe for me here.
I don't know how I'm gonna get there with my leg busted, and, wellâ¦ you're holding my ride.
Do they teach military history at your Academy, Mr.
Talis? It's, um, Councilor Talis.
And I'm not sure.
The Alornian General Sonnem Parlec used to find ways to meet his enemies blindfolded.
He said a man's mind hides behind his body.
Somehow, I doubt he ever tried this.
You're Mel's mom.
Among other things.
Squeeze, child.
You won't break it.
I do have other matters, so if you'll excuse meâ¦ The threat of the undercity is real.
-Your leadership is impotent.
We may not be Noxus, but Piltover isn't as helpless as you think.
Who said anything about Piltover? The Council is the problem.
The mind hiding behind the body.
Navigating your current crisis requires expertise you lack.
Do you know what the success rate for senior Academy inventors is? Three percent.
We're no strangers to failure.
What makes this the City of Progress is that we keep trying until we get it right.
So thank you for your advice, Mrs.
Medarda, but I have a city to run.
Wait.
I see why this province and my daughter have fallen for you.
You have the passion of youth.
I have experience.
I want you to succeed here, Jayce, to grace the world with Hextech.
But if you don't accept certain realities, I fear you'll end up like General Parlec.
Slaughtered with your eyes closed.
Three of my suppliers have said they intend to delay shipments until fall to give things "time to cool off.
" We have greater concerns than a dip in profits.
The Sheriff betrayed us.
We need better information.
We need to act.
Before anyone else gets killed.
Perhaps Marcus was operating independently.
What could anyone in the undercity offer him that he didn't have up here? It's not what they offered him, it's what he had to lose.
Councilors, my daughter has a unique insight into our situation.
Thank you.
Councilors, this is Vi.
She was born in the undercity.
Even though we failed her in countless ways, she risked everything to show me what life is really like down there.
People are starving, sick, ravaged by Shimmer.
They live in constant fear of the coordinated efforts of violent crime lords.
One man leads these efforts.
Silco.
We've done investigations of Silco.
They yielded no such level of organization.
And who led these investigations? What does this Silco even want from us? He believes the undercity should be independent.
He calls it the Nation of Zaun.
What about these? Do you know who made them? No, wellâ¦ -Uhâ¦ -Her name is Jinx.
This Jinx has the Gemstone? -Then we have to go in by force.
-That could trigger war.
-There are good people down there.
-Hmph.
Bad ones too.
Even if we wanted to invade, they have Shimmer.
We have Hextech.
What happened to you? We've been talking about talking for weeks now.
They're still cleaning the blood off the bridge.
-When do we say enough is enough? -Jayce, you don't know war.
I do.
It must be our last resort.
There may be a diplomatic solution.
She's right.
What? You want to negotiate with him? It may be the only way to avoid further bloodshed.
This is insane.
Did you learn nothing? You can't talk to him! He hates you.
Everything you stand for.
He will never back down.
-Enforcers, please escort them out.
-Forget it.
I remember where your fancy damn door is.
Vi! Wait! Wait! Where are you going? I don't know.
Back where I came from? Seems like that's what everyone up here wants.
-I can fix this.
-You can't! This is how things are.
How they've always been.
I was so stupid to think it could change.
There must be something else we can do.
Some other way.
We'll make a new plan.
We have to try.
We tried.
Okay? It wasn't enough.
Topside and bottom.
Oil and water.
That's all there is.
What about us? Oil and water.
Wasn't meant to be.
-You're just saying that.
-Do yourself a favor, Cupcake.
Go back to that big, shiny house of yours and justâ¦ forget me, okay? Viktor, I've been working on a private project for a couple weeks now.
No.
Viktor, I've been working on this for a year now andâ¦ Viktor.
Viktor, I was hoping you might take a look at something I've been working on.
Viktorâ¦ I was inspired by yourâ¦ Everything you do inspires me.
Viktor! Viktor! Sky? Sky? No.
No! Thatâ¦ that can'tâ¦ that can'tâ¦ You want to make Silco pay for what he's done? I could have you arrested.
You guys really like to bandy that threat around.
You ever been to Stillwater? -No.
So you just wave an arm, have someone dragged off, don't bother to find out what it does to someone being stuffed in a stone box for weeks, or months, or even years? -Yeah.
I want to make Silco pay.
-I want in.
There is no in.
-You heard the Council.
-Fuck the Council.
You said you were tired of doing nothing.
That's the only sensible thing that came out of anyone's mouth tonight.
I'm not a vigilante.
No, you're a victim.
-Huhâ¦ This so people notice you when you raise your hand in the boardroom? -We built them for mining the fissures.
-Hmm.
Someone close to me had a pair of these.
You're the first person Caitlyn looked for when we made it to topside.
Of everyone up here, you're the one she trusted to do something.
What do you want me to do? Arrest him? Silco controls the undercity with Shimmer.
Shut down his supply, and it's only a matter of time before his own people turn on him.
And how do we do that? Take out his manufacturing facilities.
Hit them hard and fast, before he can react.
Soâ¦ We got a deal, pretty boy? -Come on.
-Over the bridge.
Secured! Get back! You little punk.
Hey! -Hmm.
Hmm.

---

Jayce Jayce quietly mourns the red-haired child. Vi Vi attempts to console him, but Jayce decides he won't be attacking any more of Silco Silco's facilities. Vi protests. He commands her to return the Atlas gauntlets, but she refuses. He nearly attempts to seize the gauntlets by force, but simply walks away, saying she "won't make it alone." Once he's gone, Vi destroys a large machine at the heart of the facility, spilling vast quantities of shimmer onto the ground.

Some time later, Silco, Sevika Sevika, Renni Renni, and Finn Finn examine the wreckage of the destroyed facility. Renni hunches over the corpse of the red-haired child in grief; the boy was her son. The group bemoans Piltover Crest icon Piltover's sudden boldness, saying that this never would have happened if Marcus was still alive. Renni furiously condemns Silco for allowing this to happen, criticizing his over-reliance on Jinx Jinx, who killed Marcus in the first place. Finn gives Sevika a knowing glance, silently encouraging her once more to betray Silco.

Viktor Viktor grieves over Sky Sky's remains, weeping and poring over the stack of notes she left behind. Eventually, he resolves to destroy the hex core, lifting a stool over his head with the intent to smash it. However, he finds himself unable to follow through. As he walks away, the hex core sends a pulse through his body that causes him to fall to the ground, seemingly of its own free will.

Ambessa Ambessa luxuriates on Mel's Mel's balcony, accompanied by a single guard and receiving a massage from her escort. Mel storms up to her and knocks the glass of wine from her hands, commanding the escort to leave. Ambessa dismisses him and the guard. Mel berates her mother for stirring Jayce to violence. Ambessa informs her that the man who killed Mel's brother "doesn't believe the score is settled," and that she came seeking to weaponize hextech in order to protect herself and the Medarda family. Mel is appalled, insisting that she is no longer part of the family since Ambessa banished her, and asks why she did it. Ambessa confesses that Mel "weakened" her: she couldn't endure the look in her daughter's eyes when she made the "necessary decisions" to keep the family safe. She remains resolute in her quest to weaponize hextech, offering to take Mel back home if she cooperates.

Viktor sits on the ledge overlooking the pool of water from his and Sky's childhood. He scatters her ashes, saying he's unsure where she would've preferred. He begins to walk away, but turns back, contemplating throwing himself from the edge. Jayce interrupts. He reminsces about their time in the Distinguished Innovators competition, lamenting that "everything made sense then." Viktor pleads with Jayce to destroy the hex core, saying that he's unable to do so himself. He ruminates on the terrible mistakes that the pair have made, saying that they need to make it right.

Sevika, Finn, and Renni barge into Silco's office. Finn lectures Silco for his decline, saying that today is the day he dies. Silco lectures him back, calling him a parasite and berating him for his lack of loyalty. A long, retractable blade emerges from Sevika's prosthetic arm, but instead of killing Silco as planned, she slices Finn's throat. Renni flees in terror. Silco asks if Sevika had been tempted to kill him instead. She responds, "not for a worm like him." Silco examines a letter on his desk, sent from Jayce.

Silco meets Jayce on a rampart overlooking the ocean. He gives Jayce a list of demands, including free trade routes, blanket amnesty, unrestricted access to the hexgates, and sovereignty. Jayce balks at the list, retorting that Silco wouldn't stand a chance in a war between Piltover and Zaun Crest icon Zaun and claiming that he wants to save Zaun from annihilation. Silco refuses to budge, prompting Jayce to make demands of his own: discontinuing the production of shimmer, returning the hex crystal, and handing over Jinx. Silco's only problem is with surrendering Jinx, but Jayce is adamant that if he complies, he'll have his "nation of Zaun."

Ekko Ekko and Heimerdinger Heimerdinger return to the Firelight Crest Firelights' alcove. The professor is astonished at what Ekko has accomplished in such a brief period, and Ekko reveals his secret, saying, "It's not enough to give people what they need to survive, you have to give them what they need to live."

Silco visits a statue of Vander Vander, bemoaning that "it all makes sense now." He grapples with an impossible choice, between his dream of an independent Zaun, and Jinx, whom he views as his daughter. Unbeknownst to him, Jinx stands behind the statue, listening to Silco's every word, enraged at the notion that Silco might betray her.

Vi appears at The Last Drop, looking for Sevika. Sevika orders the bar's patrons to clear out, and moments later, Vi and Sevika are left alone. They fight for a long while, tearing up the bar in the process. Sevika reveals her blade, which is capable of firing heated waves of energy. Eventually, she pierces through one of the Atlas gauntlets, severely damaging it, and knocking Vi to the ground. Vi is nearly spent, but a memory of Vander convinces her to get back up again as she sheds the damaged gauntlet. As the pair continue to clash, Vi realizes that the gauntlets are capable of producing a magical force field magical force field. Sevika doesn't anticipate this, and it gives Vi a window to rip off Sevika's prosthetic arm off and finally knock her out. As Vi recovers, however, Jinx appears behind her, pistol-whipping her unconscious.

Viktor accompanies Jayce to a Council meeting. Jayce tells the Council that he is not fit to govern the people of Zaun, nor are any of them. Viktor announces that Jayce has brokered a peace with Silco in exchange for the undercity's independence. The other councilors, with the exception of Mel, are furious at the proposal, many leaping from their seats in indignation.

Vi wakes up tied to a chair in Silco's old workshop, the abandoned cannery where Mylo Mylo, Claggor Claggor, and Vander died. Jinx explains that, while Silco believes he created Jinx, it was actually Vi's voice in her head that drove her to become what she is now. Vi assures Jinx that that the only thing that sustained her in prison was the thought of getting back to her, and promises that they're "still sisters."

Jinx brings Vi's chair to a dinner table and lights the candles, revealing a macabre mimicry of a lavish meal. Silco sits across from Vi, bound and gagged. Jinx's effigies of Mylo and Claggor, as well as the stuffed bunny from their childhood, are also in attendance. Jinx berates Silco for his various lies and betrayals. She brings out a cupcake topped with the stolen hex crystal, and wheels Caitlyn Caitlyn to the table, also bound and gagged.

She states that Vi will decide where Jinx sits, referring to one chair labeled "Powder Powder" and another labeled "Jinx Jinx." She sets her shock pistol in Vi's bound hands, pleading that if Vi kills Caitlyn, she can "have Powder back." Vi refuses, prompting Jinx to retake the gun and aim it at Caitlyn's head. Frantically, Vi promises to take Jinx away and leave all of this behind them. Silco attempts to speak, and Jinx removes his gag. He accuses Vi of lying and promises that he wasn't planning on betraying Jinx. Jinx hears Mylo laughing and shoots the Mylo dummy in response, breaking a glass. Caitlyn discreetly reaches for the broken glass, hoping to cut herself loose. Silco continues to speak, assuring Jinx that she's his daughter and that he'll never forsake her.

Caitlyn breaks free. She picks up Pow-Pow Pow-Pow and aims it at Jinx, commanding her to drop the pistol. After much hesitation, Jinx places her gun on the table and puts her hands in the air, feigning surrender. Then, empowered by shimmer with superhuman speed, she rushes Caitlyn, knocking her unconscious and seizing back Pow-Pow. Vi pleads with Jinx to "wake up," listing off the names of her family: Mylo, Claggor, Vander, and their parents. However, this only serves to torment Jinx with twisted, monstrous hallucinations of the people she'd lost. Seeing how Vi is hurting Jinx, Silco furiously struggles to break his bonds. Finally, he grabs the shock pistol and takes aim at Vi, prompting Jinx to blindly fire Pow-Pow at Silco, mortally wounding him with a bullet through the chest.

Jinx hurries to Silco's side in tears, apologizing profusely. One final time, Silco promises he never would've betrayed her, telling her "you're perfect" before he dies. Vi attempts to comfort Jinx, but she stops crying and becomes stoic. Slowly, she walks to the chair labeled "Jinx" and sits down. She explains to Vi that the two of them will never be able to love each other like they used to. Then, she takes the hex crystal and walks away.

She loads the crystal into a massive rocket launcher, Fishbones Fishbones, and fires a missile missile into the sky. Caitlyn wakes up, too late to stop her. Mel removes her family ring and votes for Jayce's proposal. Sevika sits in Silco's office, recovering from her battle with Vi. Ekko and Heimerdinger converse avidly. Singed fondles a locket containing an image of a young girl, and looks up to see a bearded man bearded man hanging from the ceiling of his lab. Ambessa sees that Mel has vandalized her own painting of the Immortal Bastion using gold paint. Caitlyn frees Vi and the pair watch in horror as the rocket sails through the sky. One by one, every councilor votes to support Jayce's motion. Finally, the rocket crashes through the window of the Council chambers.

You didn't have a choice.
He knew what he was signing up for.
We're done here.
We haven't even scratched the surface.
Silco's still out there.
Do you not understand? I am part of this now! The next parents who get a message their kid isn't coming homeâ¦ I don't even know where to take it.
Do we just leave him here? You've always been a part of this.
You just never had to look it in the eye.
One dead kid? There's hundreds more where he came from, thanks to Silco, and thanks to people like you who stuck their heads in the dirt.
-This is over.
-Not for me.
Take those off.
Make me.
I can't let you leave with them.
Then, I guess you're gonna need to kill another trencher.
You won't make it alone.
Been a while since topside's gotten this bold.
Say what you want about the late Sheriff.
He had his uses.
Too bad Jinx didn't think so.
We'll buy another.
You gonna do anything about that piece of shit that murdered my boy? Let me guess, "Jinx will take care of it.
" Just like she's been taking care of everything else.
We all mourn the loss of your son, Renni.
At least, we have the solace of knowing he died fighting for our cause, instead of some petty personal dispute, as so often occurs here.
You're one to talk about sacrificing for the cause.
Where is Jinx anyhow? Help her with the body.
Viktorâ¦ I know this will probably never see the light of day, but watching how you work so tirelessly to make the world a better placeâ¦ Well, I couldn't forgive myself if I didn't try.
Everyone's gotta do their part, right? Okay.
Noxian wine is bold by comparison.
The grapes are hardened by the climate.
But then, so is everything that manages to survive in Noxus.
-Mel, would you like-- -Leave.
-Hmm.
-Stay away from Jayce! You really are fond of him.
Better yet, march back to your ship and get the hell out of my city.
Get ahold of yourself.
I taught you better.
We're in trouble, Mel.
The man who killed your brother doesn't believe the score is settled, and his resources exceed ours.
If there is a chance Hextech can be weaponized, we must have it.
Piltover isn't your testing ground.
I've only accelerated the process you started.
I wanted to protect the city from people like you.
I can't believe you'd start a war just to cover your ass.
I would set the world ablaze to protect our family.
No.
I stopped being part of this family the moment you cast me out.
Why? Why did you do it? Because you weakened me! I couldn't endure the look in your eyes whenever I made the decisions, the necessary decisions to keep us safe! We need that weapon, Mel.
Let the war unfold.
And you come home, take your place at my side.
It's where you belong.
I'm sorry.
I don't know where you'd have preferred.
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting? Remember the Distinguished Innovators competition? I remember you notching gears in the carriage over.
They started cranking the engine and the whole thing was rattling.
I thought a loose cog was gonna take someone's eye out.
At least, you didn't throw up.
Everything made sense then.
You have to destroy it.
I know.
The Hexcore.
Iâ¦ I can't do it.
You have to.
Please.
What about your disease? -Without the Hexcore-- Promise me.
Okay.
Okay.
I promise.
We lost ourselves.
Lost our dream.
In the pursuit of great, we failed to do good.
We have to make it right.
-I'm busy.
When you took Vander out of play, I thought, "Now here's a man who understands what it takes to run an enterprise.
" The attitude, the instinct, the eye.
The whole package, you were.
Always two steps ahead.
But time's lapped you, old man.
You're with him, are you? You screwed up, Silco.
You're too young to remember what the undercity was before it became an "enterprise".
We had nothing.
You know what bore us through those times? Loyalty.
Brothers and sisters back-to-back against whatever the world threw at us.
Now I'm forced to share the air with parasites like you, who leach off their legacies.
Today's the day you die, Silco.
That's a risk I've known all my life.
But I still believe in loyalty.
I would have had your son killed for this.
Though I suppose we're ahead on that account.
-Get out.
Were you tempted? Not for a worm like him.
But he won't be the last.
Hmm.
Perfect place for an ambush.
And you without your hammer.
I was reminded recently of what brought us together in the first place.
The threats beyond our walls.
This city has a short memory.
"Progress.
" Far be it from me to stand in the way.
"Free trade routes, blanket amnesty, unrestricted access to the Hexgates, sovereignty.
" Do you really think you're in a position to demand all this? I give you credit for your stunt, boy.
Didn't think you had the stomach.
But the big display followed by a request for parley, you're tipping your hand.
You're afraid.
I am afraid.
Today, I got a glimpse of what war between us might look like.
Your people wouldn't stand a chance.
The Council couldn't care less.
I'm trying to save you from annihilation.
Well, well.
Not the fresh-faced Academy pledge, are you? You want peace, this is the price.
You'll discontinue the production of Shimmer? Half there already.
Return the Gemstone.
And I need Jinx.
She has to pay for what she's done.
They weren't her crimes.
She was working for me.
Believe me, if I had it my way, it'd be you rotting in Stillwater, but we can't make a deal with a snake and cut off its head.
We both have our shitty parts to play.
Get me Jinx.
And I'll give you your nation of Zaun.
Astonishing.
You say all this came about in your own brief lifespan? How were you able to accomplish so much so quickly? You'd be surprised what you can pull off when your life depends on it.
Uh, why this form? Surely, there are more efficient and safer methods of transportation.
Firelights! -Huh? -Hmm? -Oh.
It's not enough to give people what they need to survive, you have to give them what they need to live.
A thousand times I've imagined this moment.
Never like this.
All we ever wanted.
The boy didn't even haggle.
And what do I lose but problems? Oh, it all makes sense now, brother.
Is there anything so undoing as a daughter? -Damn it.
-Piss off.
Everyone out.
Well, your guard needs working.
I wish I could say it gets easier, kiddo.
But I'd be lying.
What I can say isâ¦ She still needs you.
They all do.
-So what do you say? That's my girl.
Silco.
Bravo, sis.
Councilorsâ¦ My recent unsanctioned activities in the underground have shown me two things.
I'm not fit to govern the people who live there.
And neither are you.
Our opportunity to demonstrate our compassion, our dedication, our solidarity has passed.
They're right not to trust us.
You're walking a fine line, Jayce.
With respect, I don't give a shit what any of you think of me anymore.
Except you.
You were right.
You were always right.
My days here are numbered, but I've come with Viktor, my partner and a Zaunite, with one final proposal.
Jayce has brokered a peace with Silco.
In exchange for the undercity's independence.
What? Nonsense! We have proceduresâ¦ Really thought I buried this place.
But I should have known better.
Powder? Nothing ever stays dead.
Are we alone? -For now.
Maybe forever.
Wanna know a secret? Silco thinks he made Jinx, with all his rants and his hard-won lessons.
"Excise your doubts, Jinx.
" "Be what they fear, Jinx.
" Like everything was the same as when Vander left him.
But he didn't make Jinx.
You did.
I'm sorry, Powder.
I never meant to leave you.
You never left.
I always heard you.
Shadows in the streets, prickles on the back of my neck.
Your voice.
Pushing me.
Picking me up when all the colors were black.
You're the reason I'm still alive.
I spent so many nights in that shitty prison.
On the freezing floor, hungry, bloody, counting the hours.
The only thingâ¦ The only thing that kept me going was the thought of getting back to you.
Are we still sisters? Nothing is ever going to change that.
-I always knew you'd come back.
-What's going on? -No.
-He took everything from us.
Right here, he stabbed Vander in the back.
Just like he planned to do with me.
All the time saying you abandoned me when he knew the truth.
Liar.
Mm.
We're missing someone.
Huh? I paid your girlfriend a visit this morning.
What did you do? -I made her a snack.
-Huh? No! -Sheesh.
I'm not that crazy.
Powder! Leave her out of this.
-Nowâ¦ Where should I sit? That's your choice, really.
Make her go away.
Please.
-Send her on her way and-- And you can have Powder back.
Mm.
-I can't.
-Ah.
No! Powder, listen.
Weâ¦ we can just go.
-We'll leave and never come back.
Where would we go? No, no, no.
She's not saying that.
It's true, we'll put this behind us.
You'll never have to see him again, Powder.
What do you have to say about that? Her name is Jinx! She's lying.
You'll be with her a day before she realizes you aren't that girl anymore and turns her back on you.
Mm-hmm.
You aren't lying? You wouldn't lie to me.
Not again.
I'm not lying.
I'm on your side.
I promise.
Shut up! We're talking! The topsiders offered me everything.
Independence, a seat at the table.
All in return for you.
They can all burn.
Everyone betrays us, Jinx.
Vander.
Her.
They will never understand.
It's only us.
You're my daughter.
I'll never forsake you.
-Drop the gun! No.
Please.
It's time to leave them.
-No! Stop! Drop the gun.
-Wait! She's my sister.
Vi, she's too far gone.
No, no, no.
-Look out! You see, now finish it.
Damn it! Powder, wake up! Remember who you are! I know you remember! -Picture Mylo! Claggor! -Stop.
-Vander! -Shut up! Don't listen to her! -Dad! -Mom! -Me! No! Noâ¦ Oh.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm sorryâ¦ I never would have given you to them.
Not for anything.
Don't cry.
You're perfect.
Powder? It's okay.
We'll be okay.
I thought maybe you could love me like you used to.
Even though I'mâ¦ different.
But you changed too.
Soâ¦ Here's to the new us.
We'll show them.
We will show them all.
I support Councilor Talis' proposal for peace.

---

Jinx's surprise attack devastates the Council Meeting Room. Jayce and Mel survive and witness the immediate aftermath. Ambessa Medarda helps direct efforts of scouring for survivors. Council members Shoola and Salo are found alive, but the latter has been severely injured. In contrast Hoskel, Bolbok, and Caitlyn's mother, Cassandra, are found dead. Jayce spots Viktor, who is mortally wounded, and hastily carries him to the Academy. In a desperate attempt to save his life, Jayce reneges on his promise to destroy the Hexcore by using it for Viktor's recovery.

Piltover is left in a state of mourning after the blast. Caitlyn tries to keep her composure as the funeral for her mother comes to an end, and her casket is taken for burial. With Jayce absent, Caitlyn joins the remaining Council Members in the still-ruined meeting room. Ambessa assists a crippled Salo as the talk of granting Zaun's sovereignty crumbles and demands that Piltover's forces retaliate, armed with Hextech weaponry. But Mel and Caitlyn object as it would risk reckless escalation. Mel proposes instead to pin it on capturing Jinx and, with Silco gone, exploit the power vacuum by placing a large bounty on her that compromises her safety in Zaun. But Shoola and Ambessa side with Salo's plans for war but, convinced by Mel, that Hextech weaponry be their last resort.

Caitlyn and her father, Tobias, are still left mournful about Cassandra's passing. Caitlyn blames herself when she had the chance to take out Jinx. Tobias decides to pass down the Kiramman key, which Caitlyn thinks she's unworthy of, but Tobias reminds her the family name must now carry on with her. Vi distantly observes, of which Tobias angrily questions her presence. Caitlyn calms her father and approaches Vi, where she finally breaks down in tears. Vi tries to make it right by asking to deal with Jinx alone, but Caitlyn denies any more rouge missions as she reveals that she plans to join the Enforcers for an invasion. She hands Vi a badge, asking her to join as an Enforcer. But Vi is disgusted by this as it would betray her parents' memory when they got killed by Enforcers. She rejects the badge and leaves a dismayed Caitlyn. An embittered Vi spends the night loitering in the soaked streets of Piltover, where she is joined by a drunk Enforcer, Loris, who passes her a drink.

At the Academy, Mel checks in on Jayce as the Hexcore has now protectively wrapped itself to almost all of Viktor's unconscious body. Jayce can't figure out the Hexcore's intentions except that it wants to keep Viktor alive. Jayce learns from Mel that Ambessa is exploiting Salo's desire for retribution by pushing for the development of Hextech weaponry. He refuses to be involved as it would break another promise to Viktor. Mel assures him that she'll prevent that from happening. Jayce later pays a visit to Caitlyn as she still grapples with how the attack affected her. The two ponder the morality of using Hextech weapons.

Vi continues to drunkenly wallow in the streets of Piltover as she debates Caitlyn's offer, while Loris barely pays attention. Two Enforcers approach her, Junior Officer Maddie Nolen and her partner Steb. Vi initially assumes they're here to antagonize her. Still, Maddie admires Vi after Caitlyn retells Vi's bravery in taking down Silco to justify Vi's enlistment to the Enforcers. Vi is touched by how strongly Caitlyn vouched for her and doesn't refute Maddie's belief that Vi accepted to join. Maddie and Steb resume their duty as a memorial for the late Councilors are about to take place. Vi and Loris decide to attend as well. As crowds gather, Mel walks up on stage and gives her speech inaugurating a monument that honors the fallen Councilors.

Meanwhile, Vi takes notice of a suspicious Enforcer making his way to the stage. Cloaked figures also spread among the crowd, and one stood behind Jayce. Vi pushes herself closer upfront, but Enforcers block her from going further. The suspicious Enforcer disrupts the ceremony as she strikes Mel and fires a flare gun, signaling the start of the attack. The person behind Jayce is revealed to be Chem-Baroness Renni, who narrowly mauls Jayce with a chainsaw weapon. Panic erupts, and Vi, Caitlyn, and the Enforcers scramble to protect the Councilors from Chem-tanks. Renni plans to fight Jayce alone in revenge for killing her son. He manages to slip away briefly, but Renni is bent on finding him. Maddie and Steb evacuate the Councilors, but a Chem-tank violently halts their convoy. Vi asks Caitlyn to focus on rescuing the Councilors as she sprints for the Academy. Maddie gets carried away by a Chem-tank, but Steb frees her. The Chem-tank chases Steb, who is about to be crushed when he is saved, thanks to Loris's brute strength using a shield and Caitlyn's quick rifle shots.

Renni bloodily slashes Jayce's back and is left to a crawl. Renni closes in to deliver the final blow but gets blasted by Vi, wielding Jayce's Mercury Hammer after retrieving it from his lab. Vi and Jayce witness Caitlyn, Maddie, Steb, and Loris surrounded by Chemtanks in a last stand. Vi sees them outmatched and hurriedly prepares the hammer for another blast but struggles to reactivate it. Jayce uses his remaining strength to assist Vi in charging the weapon. Just as a Chem-tank prepares to slice, the hammer fires but is overtaken by a spear that suddenly pierces the Chem-tank. Ambessa and her elite Noxian guards finish off the remaining Chem-tanks. Ambessa executes Renni, ending the attack.

In the aftermath, Ambessa and her soldiers lead and secure efforts of recovery operations. Vi walks in on Caitlyn's tent to check on her. Caitlyn is enraged at Zaun attacking them in a time of grief. Vi pleads with Caitlyn to convince the Council to reconsider their invasion, as it would lead to terrible losses. But Caitlyn struggles to approach the situation as she doubts being capable of fulfilling her mother's role. Vi reassures her that she can't be what her mother was, but can take on her role and be beside her. Reinvigorated, Caitlyn uses the Kiramman key to unlock her family's vast knowledge and study it to formulate a plan. After another traumatic event, Jayce breaks his promise by crafting Hextech weapons, convinced that their use is now needed to win.

Shaken by the latest attack, the Councilors are forced to meet underneath their government building. Shoola is puzzled about how their enemies breached deep into Piltover undetected; Mel suspects that unknown informants in Piltover assisted in the attack. Salo pushes for invasion plans and the mass production of Hextech weapons. The meeting is suddenly interrupted by Caitlyn, now promoted as a commander, telling them that Piltover isn't ready to invade. Using her Kiramman title, Caitlyn halts all other talks by proposing to lead a strike team of her choosing at Zaun. To convince them, Caitlyn's team emerges armed with the customized Hextech weapons Jayce forged, shocking the Councilors. Maddie, Steb, Loris, and now dressed as an Enforcer, Vi, make up Caitlyn's task force with objectives to capture Jinx, dismantle Shimmer, and neutralize the remaining Silco loyalists.

At an unknown wintered forest, Singed approaches a dark cave. Inside, the two heads of a Murk Wolf growl at his presence. Undaunted, Singed breaks open a canister that begins emitting toxic fumes and prepares to use it against the wolf.

[thunder rumbling]
[footsteps approaching]
She was a great woman.
A good friend.
I don't know
how we'll face this crisis without her.
[door clunks]
[wheels squeaking]
To think we nearly extended sovereignty
to the creatures who did this.
We're charged with imposing order.
And we've been asleep at our posts.
Well, my eyes are open.
There will be no more fairy tales of peace
until we scour our basement of its demons.
So kind of you
to assist Councilor Salo, Mother.
As we are at war,
I thought it prudent to solicit the advice
of such an experienced veteran.
Let us address the matter at hand.
Our people are scared, suffering.
They need to know their leaders
have the situation under control.
An unprecedented show of force.
We flood the undercity with Enforcers,
armed with Hextech.
Innocents will be caught
in the cross fire.
How many more councilors have to be
blown to pieces before you wake up?
We are under siege.
What is she doing here?
Officer Kiramman witnessed
the attack firsthand.
She confirmed this was the act
of a single deranged individual.
Jinx.
[Mel] Silco is dead.
The underground, leaderless.
If we follow your plan,
we risk unifying them against us.
So, what is your solution? Chastisement?
A firm reprimand?
We use their division against them.
Pin the attack on Jinx,
post a reward too substantial to ignore.
I'm sorry, Mel. I'm not comfortable
trusting our fates to chance.
Jinx has proven elusive.
Our healing can only begin
once she's been brought to justice.
Then it's settled, 2 to 1.
We invade.
[sighs]
If I may? In crises such as these,
it's imperative you present
a unified front to the public,
whatever your personal feelings.
How wise.
I'll agree to endorse the invasion.
But I draw the line at Hextech.
We have an ethos.
Such force must be a final resort.
Agreed.
[thunder crashes]
Then it's settled, 2 to 1.
[thunder rumbling]
[melancholy music playing]
[footsteps approaching]
I had the shot.
Your mother left this to you.
[Caitlyn] The Kiramman Key?
No, I'm not
I don't deserve it.
It's your legacy now, Caitlyn.
What is she still doing here?
Hey.
[Caitlyn sobbing]
You were right, Cait.
Powder's gone.
I can make this right.
If you get Jayce to fix the gauntlets,
I can do this myself.
No one else needs to get hurt.
No.
No more rogue mission.
No more reckless plans.
My mother was right.
My arrogance led me
to take on more than I could handle,
and she paid the price.
They're sending
all the Enforcers after Jinx.
I'm going with them.
Please, I have to help.
You can.
As one of us.
Cait, I can't wear this.
People are calling for blood.
The Council won't stop them.
You can show
that not all of Zaun supports Jinx.
We can show them.
Together.
I watched them kill my parents.
Do you have any idea how that feels?
Yes. I do.
I thought you were on our side.
You didn't think at all.
- [yells]
- [man grunts]
[man] Hey, watch it.
Sorry.
[man] Not my first.
You all right?
[sighs, then grunts]
You, uh
lose someone in the attack?
[somber music playing]
[liquid burbling]
How is he?
Same as before. Breathing.
Pulse is consistent.
Beyond that,
your guess is good as mine.
[gasps]
What's it doing to him?
The Hexcore has been evolving.
Shifting through runic patterns
faster than I can keep up.
All I know for certain
is that it's keeping him alive.
It's the sort of puzzle
Viktor would love if he wasn't
It should be me up there instead of him.
Don't say that.
He'll come back to us.
[Jayce] I still don't understand.
He was right next to me.
How does the explosion do that to him,
and I just?
I just walk out without a scratch?
There's no sense to these things, Jayce.
How'd it go with the Council?
[scoffs] My mother's entered the game.
She's already gotten her hooks into Salo.
Using his grief
to make a play for Hextech.
Mel, I promised Viktor,
never again.
It's all right.
I handled it.
I won't let them corrupt your dream.
Caitlyn was there.
You might pay her a visit.
She hides it admirably,
but the poor girl's in so much pain.
[wind chimes tinkling]
[ethereal music playing]
[distant laughter]
[Jayce] Hey, Sprout.
[footsteps approaching]
How'd you find me?
Your dad.
Mother and I used to come here
when we needed an escape.
[chuckles dryly]
One of the few places we never argued.
I'm sorry I haven't been around.
How's Viktor?
[Jayce sighs]
I can't even tell if he's still in there.
Ever since it happened
three faces keep spinning through my mind.
I see Mother.
When they found her.
And every fiber of me just sinks,
like a stone swallowed in dark water.
But then there's Jinx.
Laughing.
I want to tear that laugh
from her throat forever.
Cait.
I know.
I just understand now
how easy it is to hate them.
One vicious act.
Then I see Vi.
I asked her to put on the uniform.
Suffice to say, she declined.
Vi? Wear a badge?
She thinks those gauntlets of yours
will solve all her problems.
What if she's right?
Hextech may keep us alive, Jayce,
but it's not what will save us.
Me.
Join the peanut patrol. Ha.
And I thought she had no sense of humor.
[man yawns] I like peanuts.
Her dad's right.
There's no point
in sticking around up here.
Except
I'm the one who created the monster.
[woman] Vi?
Who are you? And how do you know my name?
Junior Officer Nolen.
Maddie.
And, uh
it's written on your face.
[scoffs]
So, what is it?
Random search?
Escort off the property?
Or you just here to waste my time?
Search? No.
No, no. Heh.
Uh, you're something of a legend
amongst the Enforcers.
Caitlyn made quite a scene at the station
when they tried to deny your enlistment.
Now I have to ask,
is it all true?
You went after Silco alone
when the Council wouldn't back you?
Took on his whole gang?
Cait said all that?
She said if every Enforcer
had a heart like yours,
we could take on Noxus itself.
[Maddie chuckles]
Then she threatened
to withdraw her family's funding.
Anyhow, I'm glad you're joining up.
Hmm.
[Maddie] After the sheriff betrayed us
Well, let's just say
it's nice to know
there are still good ones left.
[fanfare playing]
[man] Officer Nolen.
[Maddie] Duty calls.
A real honor, Vi.
[snoring]
[sighs]
[snoring]
[solemn music playing]
- Go ahead, ma'am.
- This way, ma'am.
- Stop.
- [guard] Please keep moving, folks.
Mm-hm.
One of the many privileges
of serving as your councilor
is having the occasion now and again
to stand behind this podium
to behold so many
joined together not by birth or dictum
but by all that we share.
Our hope.
Our curiosity.
Our compulsion to leave behind us
a world better than that before.
These things we share
are what make us one people.
Today we share an unthinkable loss.
Councilor Irius Bolbok,
Councilor Torman Hoskel,
and Councilor Cassandra Kiramman
were taken from us.
But they shall not be forgotten.
We commissioned this statue
so we may remember them
for their countless contributions
their lifetimes of service.
Not for the craven act
that stole them away.
[guard] Ma'am, you can't go in
[distorted dialogue]
[Mel] Though we've suffered
a terrible blow,
I assure you,
the rule of law prevails in Piltover.
- No.
- [Mel] We will find those responsible.
And they will account for their crimes.
Awful, isn't it?
Losing a loved one.
[gasps]
[crowd screaming]
[dramatic music playing]
[leader] You aren't safe up here, toppers.
None of you are safe.
[screams]
[man] Look out!
[crowd screaming]
[roars]
[gasping]
[growls]
Go.
[screams]
[yells]
[yells]
[solemn music playing]
Get the counselors out of here.
I have an idea.
What are you doing?

For my son.

[Vi] Come on.
Shit.
[both yelling]
[somber music playing]
[Enforcer 1] Perimeter secured.
We'll see.
Thought you were gonna
get yourself killed.
[child sobbing]
[Enforcer 2] Here, come with me.
A memorial.
I got you.
What kind of animals?
They wanted the spectacle.
They're trying to scare you.
All they did is piss me off.
You
You need to find a way
to call off the invasion.
What?
This battle was on your soil.
Down there, you'll be on their terms.
None of this is on our terms.
- [Vi] Maybe you should change that.
- I don't know how, okay?
She dies and leaves this giant hole,
and I'm just supposed to fill it.
Like she was never there to begin with.
[Vi] Hey.
You won't.
The hole gets smaller, but
you never fill it.
I was wrong to spring the badge on you.
It's just
every way I slice it,
if I go after your sister alone,
one of us comes back in a box.
It's all coming apart.
[Vi] No, it isn't.
We won't let it.
[moody music playing]
[Cassandra] I know you doubt
the merit of your birthright, Caitlyn.
There's wisdom in that.
But remember:
You're a Kiramman.

Never in our lifetimes

But here we are.
Does anyone still doubt that our enemy
is greater than one deranged individual?
How did they sneak so many
of these things into the ceremony?
I thought we took every measure
to secure it.
They must have had help.
From someone up here.
[Salo] We can't afford
any more handwringing.
If we do not defend ourselves
with Hextech,
our principles will mean nothing.
- I
- [door opens]
[Caitlyn] We aren't prepared
for a full-scale invasion.
The undercity's attack proved that.
This is a closed Council meeting.
Who let you in here?
I am a decorated officer.
Leader of House Kiramman.
Address me with respect,
or keep your mouth shut.
I will lead a strike team into Zaun
with three objectives:
locate Jinx,
dismantle Shimmer,
and neutralize any agents
still loyal to Silco.
What makes you think
you'll fare better than our forces today?
[Caitlyn] We've got a few surprises
of our own.
[dramatic music playing]
[eerie music playing]
[snarling]
[melancholy music playing]

---

In the wake of Silco's death, Zaun descends into chaotic infighting by the three remaining Chem-Barons - Smeech, Margot, and Chross - now all clamoring to be on top. Jinx, grieving Silco's loss, becomes a wanted fugitive and is indifferent to the anarchy erupting as she wanders aimlessly incognito. She stumbles upon Isha, a young orphan girl on the run from Chross's men. Jinx immediately takes them all out and continues on. Isha, grateful for her rescue, cautiously tags along with her.

Smeech attempts to raid an establishment of Margot's territory, but when they arrive, the place is struck by the Grey - dense, suffocating factory smog underneath Zaun. Smeech's accountant, Heenot, is forced to investigate inside alone. Heenot steps into a terrifying encounter with an unknown figure. Later, Sevika assembles the three Chem-Barons and pleads to halt their turf wars and ally against Piltover. Margot and Chross are reluctant due to their rivalries and the recent major setbacks to their forces. Smeech speaks up, agreeing with Sevika that Piltover is a threat, but proposes that the solution is to capture and extradite Jinx to the Enforcers. Sevika is reluctant to give up one of their own, but Smeech reminds her she has no hold over their demands. Smeech will provide her with a new state-of-the-art prosthetic arm in exchange for her compliance in capturing Jinx as a last offer. Sevika retreats to the Last Drop at the late Silco's office, frustrated that she can't fix her old prosthetic and that Silco's death left her to deal with the Chem-Barons' unchecked power. Jinx makes her presence known, but Sevika can't bring herself to take her out. The two reminisce about their time with Silco and ponder their next moves without him.

Viktor awakens from his coma and peels his body off the thick webbing of the Hexcore, finding himself almost fully transformed with metal-like skin. Jayce wakes up in shock and awe at Hexcore's revival of Viktor. But Viktor realizes Jayce broke his promise of destroying Hexcore if it was responsible for his life. Jayce tries to justify his actions, but Viktor reveals that the Hexcore killed his assistant, Sky. Viktor decides to part ways with Jayce by bidding farewell to his role in Piltover.

The Firelights are facing a surge of refugees due to the undercity's continued unrest. Scar worries that they may have to turn away people, but Ekko remains firm in helping out those in need. Leaves from the hideout's large tree begin falling, and Ekko finds them all containing unknown patterns of corruption. Heimerdinger confirms Ekko's suspicions that the tree is at risk of dying, but Heimerdinger recalls having seen this development happen before. Heimerdinger and Ekko sneak into the Academy's lab to present and consult these findings with Jayce. While Jayce ponders the mystifying patterns, Heimerdinger discovers the leftover of the Hexcore cocoon and worryingly asks for Viktor's whereabouts.

Jinx tinkers a new invention from the parts she gathers at her childhood's now dilapidated arcade place. Suddenly, the place becomes gassed with the Grey, and she retreats into hiding while trying to control her breathing. From the dense smog, Caitlyn's strike team emerges and probes the area for any sign of Jinx. Vi explores on her own and picks up Jinx's welding goggles (recognizing them as Claggor's goggles), unaware that Jinx is within her gun's sights from above. Jinx struggles to pull the trigger on her own sister. She loses her chance when her tear drips down on the goggles, and Vi quickly looks up. Jinx goes back into hiding and plots a way to escape unnoticed. Jinx finds a plug that turns on the target practice music, distracting Caitlyn's team enough to investigate it. When Maddie gives the all-clear, Caitlyn fires her rifle at one of the target practice's panels in a fit of rage.

Jinx escapes while breaking down from seeing her sister as an enforcer, but Smeech's henchmen ambush her. They restrain her as Smeech reveals that they were tipping Caitlyn's team at Jinx's location after striking a deal that ended with Jinx's capture. Jinx catches him in momentary shock when she confesses to being Silco's killer. Smeech's men are prevented from hurting Jinx further when Sevika guns them down. Jinx breaks free and passes her new invention - a heavily modified and weaponized prosthetic arm - to Sevika and attaches it. Jinx, with help from Isha, takes care of Smeech's remaining men. Sevika takes down Smeech herself with the help of the prosthetic arm's wacky but brutal ability to attack. In the aftermath, Jinx intends to tie loose ends with Vi by plotting her next move with Sevika; they notice Heenot is still alive and struggling to break free from a dead member of Smeech's gang.

Viktor traverses Zaun's alleyways, littered with impoverished and starving Zaunites. Huck and other Shimmer addicts become wary of his presence and begin trailing him. Viktor is led down a path by Sky's echoing whispers and runes that only he can see. He finds himself in the center of decrepit camps infested with shimmer-addicted people. Huck leads an attempt to rob Viktor of anything of value. As they encircle him, Viktor is untroubled but is sympathetic to their suffering. He approaches a now fearful Huck and reaches out a hand to his head. A burst of bright energy erupts from Viktor's powers and begins to heal Huck from his seemingly afflictions from Shimmer. Huck's skin is freed from any sign of the Shimmer's corruption and now bears familiar marks from Viktor's abilities. Viktor declares that their suffering is ending, and the group witnessing his miracle begins to kneel and bow in worship. Viktor notices Sky's spirit touching a joyous Huck's shoulder, looking at Viktor proudly. Viktor looks back and smiles.

Singed is seen experimenting on some cells from the harvested organs of the Murk Wolf carcass hanging in chains.

Well, you know, far be it from me,

Shitter?
[Heenot] Not exactly the term I
Ever wonder why fat brains like you

No, uh, never.
You only use half your head.
Plotting moves.
Calculating odds.

With his bare teeth.
It just, you know, seems, uh, hasty.
Last count, Margot had
at least ten hitters guarding the stash.
Margot and Chross can buck
all they want, but in the end,
I'll be the one smiling.
Until I'm in Silco's chair,
your only job is

[all coughing]
[Heenot] The Grey.
All the way up here?
What do you know? Cleared the place out.
Might have made our jobs a lot easier.
No, no, no. We can't.
It's factory smog trapped underground.

[Sevika] I know you're all fantasizing
about sawing each other's heads off.
So I'm gonna get right to it.
These turf wars have to stop.
These two have been the aggressors.
I've only defended my interests.
Playing coy doesn't suit you, love.
You started this dance
when you raided the Rapturewalk.
What could I want
with your boulevard of filth?
Topside is the real enemy.
Us killing each other
is playing right into their hands.
Our best shot is
to put aside these petty squabbles
and join forces.
Ally with these two?
I rather favor my chances with Topside.
Even together,
they outnumber us four to one.
That's before all the recent casualties.
Might matter up there,
but they don't know the first thing
about fighting in the fissures.
Hmm.
Is he dead?
Why is he so quiet?
She's right.
We don't get Topside off our backs,
we don't last.
But I got a different solution.
We give them Jinx.
It's all they really want.
We don't hand over our people.
"We"? You don't do much
of anything anymore, do you, magpie?
Bird without a wing's
just a funny-looking rat.
[laughs]
Struck a nerve, did I?
Okay, I'll make you a deal.
You help me put a bow on Baby Blue
for our friends upstairs,
I'll cut you a brand-new puncher,
top of the line, all the fixings.
Think on it.
But I promise,
it's the last offer you're gonna get.
[jug clatters]
[sighs]
I can't believe you're dead
and I'm still mopping up your messes.
[Jinx] Jeez, lady, you crazy?
Talking to dead people.
You here to finish me off?
Haven't I done you enough favors?
Same time every day.
Big baby couldn't do it himself.
[sighs]
- Couldn't do much himself.
- Mm.
About now, he'd have me all over the Lanes
running his collections.
Building his weapons.
Making his deals.
Exploding his enemies.
He dips out,
the whole world flips over.
[seethes]
- [yells]
- [chair splinters]
All his plans.
Everything we built.
The hell we supposed to do now?
Watch it all burn.
What'd I tell you?

Oh! Oh, uh
You must be cold.
Cold.
No, I don't think so.
I sense a charge.
A potential.
A recursive impulse.
Unpleasant, but
"cold" isn't its name.
The Hexcore.
Viktor, it saved you.
Somehow it It adapted to your injuries,
changing and evolving.
It was as if it was connected to you.
I did my best using the notes
from your leg. Recorded everything.
- There are still so many questions, but
- I was supposed to die.
You promised to destroy the Hexcore.
No.
Don't you see?
Heimerdinger was wrong.
We were wrong. It's not as bad as we
It killed Sky, Jayce.
What?
No.
She had such dreams.
As did we once.
I'm going to resign from the Council.
I understand now.
My place was always here
in the lab with you.
We'll make this right. Together.
[Viktor] I must say goodbye
to this place now.
To you.
Goodbye?
Viktor, you're my partner.
Our paths diverged long ago.
It was affection that held us together.
You think it's so easy?
To turn your back while your city
looks to you for salvation?
To cling to principles while
your best friend bleeds out in your arms?
I never asked for this.
Where are you going?
Goodbye, Jayce.
[Ekko] There's so many of them.
It's all the fighting.
We're gonna have capacity issues soon.
Then there's the security risk.
We're not turning people away.
All these years,
we finally get rid of Silco,
just so a new one can take his place.
[sighs]
[group chattering]
Now watch this.
[Heimerdinger]
Oh, this is quite troubling.
That tree means so much.
It's our food. Fresh air.
We built our whole identity around it.
Every time it seems
like we might catch a break
Ah, now, it's not lost yet, lad.
If there is a means of preservation,
by golly, we'll find it.
I have seen something
of this nature before.

Professor?
Yes, of course.
- What the devil's gotten into you?
- I thought
Why are you breaking into my lab?
And who's he?
This is my new pupil, Ekko.
Ekko, my former pupil Jayce.
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
[Heimerdinger]
I apologize for the intrusion.
We were attempting to sneak in.
Oh, pishposh. Like you've never done it.
Were you sleeping here?

You drink tea, Ekko?
[Heimerdinger humming]
Ah.
[grunts]
You're right.
It matches the corruption we saw
on the plants we tested with the Hexcore,
but where did you say you found this?
Deep in the underground.
Ekko's home is a marvelous place.
Truly a wonder.
- You should see what

Uh, right, uh, when I said "home,"
I was, of course,
referring to his cognitive center.
- Not a physical location hidden in the

Did any of the plants survive?
They weren't what we were trying to save.

Ah, ah, ah. They want you alive.
But don't think
I won't skewer out those peepers.
Drawback of you long-range types.
Me? I'm the kind of guy
who likes to get in close.
Never thought I'd catch you blubbering.
Wonder if Silco even saw that.
[Jinx] Twice.
When he met me
and when I killed him.
You?
It's always me.
Whether I'm pulling the pin or not,
everyone who gets close to me dies.
Wanna know the real kicker?
You're the kind of guy
who likes to get in close.

Caitlyn uses the Kiramman Key, learning to create the Undercity's ventilation system that stores the suffocating smog of the Gray, which House Kiramman developed. Caitlyn decides to weaponize it in the strike team's pursuit to find Jinx. With the Gray's use, they overwhelm the remaining Silco loyalists and have either arrested or killed the last Chem-Barons. They later stumble upon Heenot in one of the Gray's vents, tied upside-down on a propeller. When they try to rescue him, terrifying dolls of the Strike Team's likeness drop down as a warning from Jinx.

When Heenot is freed, he tips them about Jinx heading for the old tunnels and has plans for the ventilation system. Caitlyn dismisses Heenot to be incarcerated despite Heenot cooperating. Vi, worried for Cait, asks to speak with her privately. With Jinx knowing of their presence, Vi pleads to have Maddie, Steb, and an injured Loris return to Piltover for their safety from Jinx's trap. Vi reaffirms her commitment to taking down Jinx but pleads with Caitlynn not to change, seeing her increasingly vengeful after Cassandra's death. Caitlyn promises before the two share a kiss.

In a Noxian flagship, Ambessa reluctantly entertains a private audience with Amara, assuming it's a request from Piltover's Merchant Guild. However, dark magic suddenly entangles Rictus and Ambessa. Amara reveals herself as a member of the Black Rose, intent on assassinating Ambessa to thwart her plans for Piltover. Rictus uses his spear, infused with protection runes, to have him and Ambessa break free. Ambessa swiftly kills Amara but knows her death won't stop the Black Rose. Ambessa must ramp up their plans now but keep Mel uninvolved.

Salo is seeking treatment via Shimmer for his crippled legs by a Vastaya named Lest. Lest hears someone approaching and quickly ends the session with Salo. Ambessa enters and orders Lest to leave. Ambessa expresses her distaste for Salo's downward spiral, which is evident in how he lets Caitlyn overrule him during the last Council meeting. But Salo explains that the Kiramman title outranks him and even a Medarda. Ambessa tells an eager Salo to rally the influential families of Piltover for a grand meeting at the Council Room.

Meanwhile, Mel sneaks backstage at Piltover's Opera House during a performance. Awaiting her is Lest for an arranged meeting. Lest has been acting as Mel's spy over Salo and Ambessa but now wishes to retire in fear of being discovered and Mel using her as a scapegoat. Mel tries to reassure Lest, as her role is important in keeping Mel's mother from putting Piltover in harm's way. Lest relays what she heard in her eavesdropping; Ambessa and Salo gather Piltover's great houses for an announcement, assuming it to prop up Salo as a leader with Ambessa pulling the strings. Lest hands Mel a specialized Shimmer dart that she could use to kill Salo before she disappears. Later, Elora confirms Lest's tip that Salo privately gathers Piltover's nobles. Elora also delved into the mystery of how Mel's brother died, which subsequently led to Ambessa being stripped of her possessions. Mel deduces her mother is getting desperate and plans to finalize using the Shimmer dart.

Jayce, Ekko, and Heimerdinger discuss the implications of the Hextech's overuse with Viktor's theory of "Wild Runes", where Arcane anomalies may have caused the corruption pattern to appear in the tree's leaves of Ekko's base. Jayce realizes that the tree caught the corruption because it was underground and leads Ekko and Heimerdinger to check the Hex Vault deep beneath. Jayce opens the doors, revealing the Vault. Ekko angrily realizes that the core of the Hex Gates uses the same utility ducts that carry clean water and power the vents throughout the Undercity, deducing how the corruption has spread. Their argument goes unnoticed by Heimerdinger as he discovers that the corruption pattern is also present within the Vault. When Heimerdinger tries to observe closer, it reacts by having the core enveloping them all in a white void. All three discover a huge mutating orb in the center, leaving Jayce dumbfounded about what it is.

Caitlyn and Vi travel deeper into the Undercity's deep chasm of vents, where they find a trail of canisters with Jinx's graffiti. They make it to a large ruined temple of Janna, where its pillars are covered in graffiti, suspecting this is where Jinx is. Before Vi steps, she asks Caitlyn not to hesitate when she has a clear shot. Vi then calls her sister "Jinx" for the first time. Jinx's answers echo throughout as Vi and Caitlyn watch for any sign of her. Jinx calls out Vi's joining the Enforcers and their cruel use of the Gray. Vi declares she's no longer the sister she knew and vows to stop Jinx. Jinx finally reveals herself to Vi. Caitlyn lines up her shot of Jinx and fires. But it turns out to only be a mirrored reflection of Jinx to lure out Caitlyn. Watching from afar, Isha points to Sevika's location before confronting her. Vi is left to confront Jinx on her own. The two sisters descend into battle.

Jayce reaches out to touch the orb, which violently begins reacting as it glitches out Jayce's hammer. Heimerdinger and Ekko are also affected as they are ripped apart and disappear, leaving Jayce as his finger touches the orb, and he is affected by the orb's chaos. His last words are, "What have we done?" before fiercely smashing the orb with his hammer, causing him and the orb to vanish. The Hex Vault returns to normal, but not before a wave of chaotic energy erupts and spreads throughout the underground.

Vi, Jinx, Caitlyn, and Sevika's fight is being affected by the events at the Hex Vault, where their Hextech weapons malfunction chaotically but carry on. Caitlyn manages to overpower Sevika and limps her way to the clashing sisters. Caitlyn takes a shot at Jinx, and her bullet rips away Jinx's right hand's middle finger. Vi manages to subdue Jinx finally and prepares to kill herself. Jinx submits and tells Vi she's glad it would be her sister who will do the deed. Vi hesitates enough for Isha to charge in, grab Jinx's pistol, and put herself between them, aiming it at Vi. The three are left in a standoff as Isha keeps a protective stance for Jinx.

However, Caitlyn manages to unarm Isha with a clean shot, but as a desperate act to save her, Isha uses herself to shield Jinx and refuses even when Jinx is trying to get her away. Caitlyn orders Vi to stay clear as she readies another shot. Horrified, Vi asks her to stand down as she would kill Isha, but Caitlyn refuses and fires at Vi, barely shielding them with the gauntlets. Vi charges and disrupts the shot when she reloads to the fire by grabbing the rifle's muzzle downwards. All three are in shock, but Jinx notices that Sevika is working to activate the bombs, and Jinx calls her to stop too late. The explosion destroys a large vault holding the Gray, erupting with powerful gusts that blow away Vi and Caitlyn to the entrance. The Gray rapidly climbs upward, activating the canisters Jinx planted, which converts the smog into different colors.

Huge plumes of the now colorful Gray burst from Piltover's underground vents and sweep across Piltovian residents. People from the Undercity are unaffected, and they watch Gray affect Piltover for the first time. Caitlyn and Vi soon recover, and Caitlyn angrily uses her rifle in a futile effort to break open the now rubble-covered entrance to get to Jinx. Vi tries to snap her out, to which Caitlyn calls out Vi, stopping her from finishing off Jinx. But Vi points out a child was blocking her shot and is appalled that she would disregard that. Caitlyn starts to leave, believing that Vi is no different from Jinx. When Vi grabs her arm, Caitlyn painfully hits her with her rifle and leaves Vi behind on the ground, heartbroken and in tears.

In the aftermath, Piltover is left reeling from the sudden attack, with much of the city still covered in JInx's paint brought by the Gray. Elora and Mel give a knowing look at what they must do as Mel brings with her the Shimmer Dart for the upcoming meeting. However, Elora suddenly becomes paralyzed, and Mel notices. Elora and Mel are suddenly swarmed by dark magic as the Black Rose abducts them both.

Salo thanks all the attending great families at the Council Room before he gives the floor to Ambessa. Ambessa opens up by fabricating Amara's cause of death at the hands of Zaunite assassins and pleads with Piltover to retaliate against the Undercity after a series of atrocities that befell them by declaring a state of Martial Law. To do this, they must all unanimously agree to a General overseeing operations and that Ambessa will serve as an advisor with her Noxian army in service. Salo presumes Ambessa will choose him for the role, but Ambessa sidelines him for Caitlyn Kiramman to take command. Caitlyn is in shock, but the ruling Houses have begun to agree.

Ambessa leads them on with a pounding salute that her soldiers and soon most of the Enforcers follow. It is revealed that Ambessa had Rictus approach the Chem-Baroness Rennie to push her in vengefully attacking Piltover during the Memorial so that Ambessa be hailed a savior when she publicly executes Renni herself, therefore influential in having Piltover agree to her plan of military rule. The plan comes to completion when Caitlyn accepts Ambessa's invitation to take on the mantle. Ambessa promises Caitlyn that her mother will have justice before Caitlyn returns the salute as well, cementing her as General.

Singed begins feeding his blood into his new experiment of a huge hanging wolf-man hybrid.

[sneezes]
[breathing deeply]
Thanks. I thought I was a goner.
[Vi] You're Smeech's man.
[Heenot] Was.
Not anymore. Name's Heenot.
I [sneezes]
Oh, I decided
it was time for me to retire.
Looks more like
someone decided to retire you.
Yeah, well, timing was never my strong
[sneezes]
Sorry.
Sorry, it's It's the Grey.
It gives me the [sneezes]
Tell us how you wound up here.
[Heenot] Hey, wait, wait.
Jinx is off the rails, even for her.
She's got a real fire lit under her ass.
She's planning something big,
right here in the pipeworks.
- It's a pretty big place down here.
- [grunts]
She was headed towards the old tunnels.
Something about rerouting the vents.
- This is it, then. Cuff him.
- Hey, I told you everything I know.
[Caitlyn] You're a confessed criminal.
You'll spend your retirement in a cell.
Check your gear.
This is what we've trained for.
Can I get a minute?
[Ambessa] Your first request
for an audience was uninteresting.
The second, inappropriate
for someone of your station.
The third
plain annoying.
People have lost their heads for less.
So tell me, Amara,
what does a member
of Piltover's merchant guild want from me?
I'm not here representing the guild.
I've come here to settle a debt.
My bookkeeper is down the hall.
What you've stolen
[with hissing echo]
is more precious than any gold.
[suspenseful music playing]
[screeching]
Did you truly believe
Piltover was beyond our reach?
My son is dead.
Is that not enough to sate your bloodlust?
I haven't insulted
your intelligence, Ambessa.
Do not insult mine.
We know what you're chasing in Piltover.
We will not allow it.
Allow?
Thank you.
Your visit only confirms my suspicions.
Try to stop me, insolent witch.
[groaning]
[gurgles]
My death means nothing.
You should have given up the feud.
[wheezes]
You have no inkling what family is to me.
[knife pierces deeper]
[gasping]
Triple the guard.
This will have consequences.
We need control now.
Salo isn't ready.
Perhaps it's time we involved Mel.
No. We must distance ourselves.
She's safer as our enemy.
I'll handle Salo.
Mm.
Her disappearance
won't go unnoticed for long.
It's worse than that.
[screeching]
We should cut the others loose.
[scoffs]
Listen, if that Heenot idiot
is telling the truth,
Jinx is gonna have surprises
in store for us.
All the more reason to bring backup.
She'll smell their nerves a mile away
and find a way to use them against us.
Tell me I'm wrong.
I can't let her get away again.
Are you sure you're ready to?
My sister is gone.
There's only Jinx now.
It has to end.
I'm so sorry about your mother.
I'm sorry I can't bring her back,
but please just
Everyone in my life has changed.
Promise me you won't change.
[tender music playing]
I won't.
[lilting folk music playing in distance]
[crowd clamoring in distance]
[footsteps approaching]
- [sighs]
- Out.
Do you realize how easy it was
for me to track you down here?
Hmm. Well, I do own the place.
It's enough work propping you up
without you dulling what few wits
are left rattling around in there.
If you propped as well as you prod,
maybe I'd have better uses for my time
than sitting around waiting for an update
on Princess Kiramman's
underground escapades.
She's gotten no closer to Jinx.
But that doesn't seem
to steal the stars from anyone's eyes.
Perhaps if you hadn't let a child
overpower you in your own chamber.
It's not the girl.
It's the name.
It bewitches people.
You should know.
Do you really think
Mel could have succeeded?
Never speak ill of my family.
[gasping]
Why are you here?
To sober you up.
Mission accomplished.
It's time.
Rally every house and family
with even a modicum of influence.
Can you manage that?
Wait. For certain?
Yes, of course.
Whatever you need.
There is another matter,
concerning your guild merchant Amara.
[choir singing traditional music]
[man] And, yes.
Lift.
Fantastic stuff.
[choir resumes singing]
[Mel] Good to see you again, Lest.
[Lest] I'm out.
Keeping an eye on a councilor
with peculiar tastes doesn't rattle me.
But that woman
You met my mother? What did she want?
I don't know. They kicked me out
before I could hear any of it.
We both know you heard every word.
I'm sorry, but I really can't.
Lest, this is vitally important.
I need to know.
This was never about Salo.
You're using me to get to her.
And then what?
You take what you need,
hang me out to dry? Hmm?
I'm expendable?
No, no one is expendable.
That's what this is all about.
Everything with my mother
is a calculated risk.
I'd love to promise your safety,
but I can't make any assurances
other than this:
If my mother gets what she wants,
the whole city will suffer.
And right now you're the only one
who can stand in her way.
They're setting up some big announcement.
All the who's who.
Aiming to take over
and put Salo in the hot seat, but
we know who's really pulling the strings.
I caught a name. Amara.
I don't know what you make of that.
Here, brand-new cocktail. All the rage.
It's made with Shimmer.
Leaves traces on the body.
That should be all you need
to shut Salo down.
Thank you.
For what it's worth
dangerous as she is,
your mother was spooked.
I could smell it.
Like a cat backed into a corner.
[machinery whirring, groaning]
[eerie music playing]
[vapor hissing nearby]
Viktor hypothesized that there may be
something he called "wild runes."
Patterns that occur naturally
where the border
between our world and the Arcane is thin.
[Ekko] Runes like the ones
you use in Hextech.
What's the difference
between those and wild runes?
[Jayce] Pass me a tome.
I used words you understood
in order to elicit your action.
This is what Hextech runes are.
Pass me a tome.
- Pass me a tome.
- [sighs]
There, you sighed.
Still a kind of language.
A sound, but not words.
Something raw. Natural.
That's wild runes.
Most places, the Arcane is dormant,
but here and there, it's more active.
- Wild runes are
- Sort of like its fingerprints.
[Jayce] Exactly.
So you're telling me
that pattern is on my tree
because you pissed the Arcane off
with all your demands?
That's That's not what I
Oh, the lad may be onto something.
Every action sparks a reaction.
Oh, ball sockets.
Do you think this could actually
be a result of overuse of Hextech?
I've seen miracles spring
from the hands of mages many times,
but so often,
they turned to horrors.
I'd always presumed
it was due to mankind's
turbulent relationship with power.
But perhaps it is a property
of the Arcane itself.
We tested our Hextech under
every conceivable condition for years.
If there's some reaction taking place,
how come we've never seen
any sign of it until now?
And why would it appear
on a tree, deep underground?
Hmm.
[dramatic music playing]
[door opens]
[footsteps approaching]
[Elora] Your source panned out.
I've confirmed Salo met privately
with members of several houses today.
I should have been first
to bring this to you.
I promise I wouldn't have missed it.
It's just such a bold move.
And at this moment, it's
[Mel] Foolish.
Of course, your mother
is anything but a fool.
There must be an angle I'm missing.
Hmm.
Did you look into the other matter?
There's a rat's nest of misinformation
surrounding your brother's passing.
Whomever he crossed knows
how to cover their tracks.
Moreover, they've managed to strip
your mother of most of her holdings.
She's desperate.
Which makes her all the more dangerous.
What are we going to do?
Summon the apothecary.
I'll want his opinion of this.
And check in on Amara.
[Ekko] This is still part of the Hexgates?
We must be at least 200 feet
below the surface.
[Jayce] The entire structure is a channel,
focusing the Hextech energy
into a precise beam.
[suspenseful music playing]
[distorted laughter]
Cait.
If you see an opening
take the shot.
[Caitlyn] Vi.
[Jayce] How do you
know so much about its design?
[Ekko] Read what I could,
deduced what I couldn't.
Plus, I didn't think the Topside
would trust anything that important
below the surface.
[dramatic music playing]
I thought the gemstone mesh
was installed aboveground.
[Jayce] The mesh is aboveground,
but we weren't sure what would happen
if the gate overloaded,
so we installed a failsafe at the base.
So instead of it exploding
in your neighborhood,
it would blow up in ours.
We're miles from the main fissures.
These are the same utility ducts
that carry our water
and facilitate our ventilation.
That would explain it affecting the tree.
Inconceivable.
[Ekko] You know, you say we should
feel like we're all one people.
But whenever it rains,
we're the ones that get wet
What the?
Jinx!
[echoing] Jinx! Jinx! Jinx!
[Jinx] Finally got the name right.
Guess there really isn't
a crack in the earth
where you won't find me.
What is this place?
[Jinx] Don't you remember
the old Janna bedtime stories
Vander used to tell us?
[in melodramatic voice]
Miners trapped underground.
Air running thin!
But then some wispy wind woman
wafts to their rescue.
[Jinx snickers]
Wild the kind of crap people get up to
when you choke them out.
We used the Grey to clear the streets.
To keep people safe.
"We."
Never thought my sister
would turn bluebelly.
Never thought mine would orphan kids.
[Jinx] Ha! Why not?
Done it to myself enough.
But plastering my face all over
so someone else would do your dirty work?
Poisoning our air?
[Jinx whistles]
You've turned a leaf, sister.
I'm done blaming myself for your mistakes.
Done pretending you're my sister.
You're not.
You killed her.
I'm not gonna let you
stain her memory anymore.
[Jinx] Then stop me.
'Cause no matter what I do,
I just can't seem to die.
[whispers] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
[laughs]
[Jinx] I know you're sweet on her.
Hope you got a chance to, you know
Before [laughs]
I'm ready.
[gasps]
Is that a wild rune?
[Jayce] I have no idea what that is.

We spoke of rebuilding,

I tried to save her.
But the blade pierced her heart.

[Ambessa] Our families should not need

It's time to end this.
You've given Zaun
opportunity after opportunity

and how have they answered?
Half your council is dead.
Your memorial is made a massacre.
Well, no more.
Wrath must be met with wrath.

Appoint a general to lead
until this threat is vanquished.
Someone who will not pale

A pillar of your community

Who may consider my experience

Laying by her bedside, Caitlyn contemplates the current events, and Maddie, sleeping beside her, listens to her lament.

At an undisclosed location, Jinx has a match against Isha using two bugs called Stink Maw and Scuttle Butt to settle their score. Ultimately, Isha wins, and Jinx is forced to follow Isha's request to give her a makeover that makes her appear just like herself. After this, Jinx has a heart-to-heart with Isha about how she reminds her of her sister Vi. Although Isha wants Jinx to fight, Jinx tells her she's renounced her old ways.

At another undisclosed location, Ambessa beside Rictus watches as a scientist runs an experiment on the hexcore crystal. The experiment is deemed a failure as the scientist is vaporized after he activates the machine the crystal was attached to. Ambessa lashes out at the failure and that both Jayce and Heimerdinger are missing, but also the Black Rose has her daughter, which Rictus assures her all will be fine.

Later, Rictus captures a Jinx sympathizer and openly declares to the onlookers that Jinx is not a savior. As it happens, Isha, dressed as her, appears and creates a scene, causing the other sympathizers to take down the Enforcers there.

Afterward, Caitlyn and Maddie discuss the Jinx copycat event until they're joined by Ambessa, who requests a private chat with Caitlyn. Hence, Maddie leaves, and Ambessa expresses her concern that Jinx would ignite a staunch resistance by the Zaunites against them. Despite not trusting Ambessa and her ways, she asks Ambessa if she has any ideas, and she proposes arresting someone who may know of Jinx's location. Caitlyn was questionable on that, citing peace must always be settled with violence, but Ambessa argues that it must be done and leaves the final decision to her.

A drunken Salo receives his Shimmering treatment from Lest, all while he laments about his faded fame. Before Lest leaves, she suggests that Salo seek further treatment from a man from the fissures who have performed miracles on Shimmer addicts.

Sevika visits Jinx's hideout to confront her about her stunt done at the checkpoint and the buzz surrounding her return. However, Jinx refuses to appear despite Sevika trying to coax her by mentioning Silco. Before leaving, Sevika mentions a rally with her sympathizers at Vander's statue.

Later, Jinx has a heart-to-heart with Silco's old chair that she superimposes as Silco himself.

Meanwhile, Caitlyn admires the dead council member's statue; Rictus interrogates the Jinx sympathizer and learns about the rally at the statue, and Scar pays his respects at the Firelights tree.

Eventually, Sevika holds the rally as promised at Vander's statue, where, after her compelling speech, Isha stands on top of the statue and lights up a blue flare. Moments after she does, Rictus tosses his weapon at Sevika, severing her mechanical arm, and he, alongside Noxus soldiers and Enforcers, starts mass arresting everyone there. Isha futilely tries to fight against Rictus but is easily outmatched by him. Singed, who cared a runic symbol on his hand with a knife, holds his hands in the air for the Enforcers who threaten to shoot him. While he does this, the blood from his hands drips onto the ground as the beast in his lair awakens.

Returning to her hideout, Jinx finds that Isha is gone. Soon, Sevika arrives and informs her that Isha was at the rally and everyone there was arrested. The news causes Jinx to experience one of her psychosis episodes.

Riding a vehicle to prison, Isha talks to the calm Singed, who tells her the secret: they won't be staying long. As it so happens, the monster from his basement follows his scent to where Singed Blood is left and follows its trail.

To gain access to the prison, Jinx and Sevika steal an Enforcer outfit, which Jinx puts on and grants them access to the prison. It's there that as the Warden stamps them in, Ambessa passes by, but does not engage with them.

Granted access into the prison, Sevika and Jinx take out the guards and release the prisoners there.

Outside, Ambessa has an encounter with Singed's Monster.

Right as Jinx and Isha reunite with each other, several Enforcer guards arrive, but are soon taken out by Singed's monster, who arrived in an elevator. Jinx fights against the creature as Sevika takes Isha and runs. When the creature has Jinx at his mercy, he regains his consciousness and calls Jinx, Powder.

Up again?
The city's not going anywhere.
I have an audience with the Masons'
Guild first thing in the morning.
Let me guess.
Complaints about the Noxians.
Hmm. They doubled their
fortification requests.
Again. To keep
Keep us safe.
I never expected this to go on so long.
I thought
I don't know what I thought.
Just
it wasn't this.
You could call it off.
Withdraw from the underground.
Reestablish the Council. All
you have to do is give the order.
Not without Jinx.
Besides, a withdrawal could lead
to a worse situation than the one
Ah. Okay, Ambessa.
She delivered us Zaun,
as she vowed.
Without her, who knows how
many Enforcers we'd have lost?
I've learned so much from her.
You're our leader.
The Enforcers, Piltover,
they follow you.
I follow you.
I'll come to bed soon.
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're in the wrong place.
Scumbags and scalawags,
put your hooks and paws together
for the meanest, ugliest,
goriest spectacle of your lives.
In the gray corner,
our undefeated champion.
With claws like daggers
and teeth like sharper daggers.
The devilish,
the wretched
Stink Maw!
And in the other gray corner,
the challenger.
A rising star,
with hideous mandibles
and a face that would
make a brood mother squirm.
The creepy,
the dastardly
Scuttle Butt!
Two will enter.
And after that, who knows?
Handlers, release your beasts.
No, no. What are you doing?
Show some effort.
Congratulations on your victory.
Well, you're past your prime, champ.
Only thing to do is
Hmm. A rematch?
Return of the titans.
Vengeance. Redemption.
The inexplicable
release of bodily gases.
All right, all right.
I still think it's a dumb idea.
But I guess you won,
and a deal's a deal.
I guess.
Ta-da!
You like it?
You're lucky.
I didn't get to do much
of this with my older sis.
She was more into
hitting things.
I had a different name
back then, you know.
Powder.
Stupid, right?
I thought I was rid of
her for good, but, uh
you kind of remind me of her.
Pew.
Did Sevika put you up to this?
That's a past life, kid.
And it was about as
sweet as last year's milk.
Jinx is dead.
Hmm.
How, in a city teeming
with brilliant inventors,
have we managed to unearth
such unrelenting incompetence?
This is their doing.
We can't be certain the Black
Keep their name out of your mouth.
We can't be certain the Order
was also behind the disappearance
of Jayce and Heimerdinger.
Who else?
The moment we seize
control of this backwater,
everyone with an inkling
of talent vanishes.
It's no coincidence.
Our instincts were right.
They fear Hextech.
But we were too slow.
How could I not secure the scientists?
They have my daughter, Rictus.
Our moment will come.
But you must be prepared.
To expedite processing,
have any and all bags open
and ready for examination.
Officers ask for your
cooperation and compliance
as we make every attempt to ensure
the safety and security of Piltover.
Next. Move along.
To expedite processing
You have Jinx to thank for this.
She is not your friend.
She is not your champion.
She hides while you suffer.
And yet you refuse to hand her over.
the safety of all citizens
Let's go.
Jinx.
You're right.
It's hers.
I'd recognize it anywhere.
That's where the similarities end.
No body count. No theatrics.
You think it's a copycat?
I think we've made them desperate
for something to believe in.
This doesn't have to change
what we talked about this
morning. You can still
Officer Nolen.
Quite the familiar face these days.
General.
I'd like a word with Commander Kiramman.
In private.
I suppose I don't need to advise you
on the hazards of
professional entanglements.
Nor is that the advice
you rushed here to provide.
It's beyond question that
the news of Jinx's return
will ignite Zaunite resistance.
But the blade cuts both ways.
There's a trail.
We have her scent.
I'd expected this development
would encourage you.
Was it for my encouragement
that your man Rictus
was instigating violence?
You don't trust me.
"The blade cuts both ways."
Fearless child.
You never shy.
You have a recommendation?
If it wasn't Jinx at the checkpoint,
one of them knows where she is.
Arrests require cause.
What greater cause is there than
returning peace to this city?
Why is peace always the
justification for violence?
We've lost so many.
The anger, the sorrow
It's tiring.
Gods, I know it's tiring.
But you will never rest
knowing that she's out there.
Or maybe I underestimated you.
Maybe you have the strength I do not.
To forgive
and trust in tomorrow.
The decision is yours, commander.
I hosted the most
lavish galas in the city.
It was a measure of status
to be on my guest list.
Toast of the town.
Now people avert their
gaze when I roll by.
My gaze isn't averted.
Oh, spare me.
I wouldn't have hired you
if you weren't versed in the art
of indulging your clients' egos.
Plus you're one of the few councilors
left from the old batch, right?
Never learned anything about
the younger Medarda, did they?
Even when she's not here,
she's all anyone talks about.
I get it.
She's the last heir
of the great Medardas.
But the writing's on the wall.
When you're missing this
long, you're not coming back.
- Same time next week?
- Tomorrow.
The effects have been diminishing.
Huh.
I keep hearing about this
healer down in the fissures,
way out on the fringes.
They say he makes miracles happen.
I saw one.
Like nothing I'd ever seen before.
Can't hurt to look, can it?
You could have warned me.
Fat chance. About what?
Your stunt at the checkpoint.
No idea what you're babbling about.
That wasn't you?
Hmm.
Hmm.
Well, however it happened,
the whole undercity's
buzzing, saying you're back.
- So I'm thinking
- Not your strong suit.
Would make a world of
difference if you showed up.
You're a symbol.
Ha. You want a symbol?
Silco spent his whole life
trying to rally the undercity together.
Stupid joke that it is,
you have the chance to pull it off.
I told you, I'm not interested.
Do you know how much he
sacrificed to protect you?
He believed in your potential.
Well, then he shouldn't have died!
We're having a rally tonight.
Vander's statue.
Firelights, your fans
Anyone I can bring to the table.
Stick your head in the dirt if you want,
but this fantasy you've
been living out here,
it's not gonna last forever.
Don't trip on the way out.
I don't know how you do it, kid.
I gotta go bother someone.
Still giving me the
silent treatment, huh?
Between you and Isha,
I'm losing my snappy comebacks.
Me, a hero.
How screwed up is this place?
I know Sevika's right,
and I probably owe it to you,
on account of the murdering and all.
But I got something going now.
A friend.
And I don't want to mess it up.
Maybe that's what I was like for you.
If you care so much about me
playing your stupid revolution game,
speak up now, or I guess
I guess you
You're really gone.
And there's no reason
to stay here anymore.
Statue
Vander's statue
It's no secret we got history.
Blood spilt on all sides.
But we grew up on the same streets.
Ate the same scraps.
Like it or not, we're
in this mess together.
Enforcers raiding our homes.
Noxians down our throats.
Innocents getting
carted off to Stillwater.
We gotta choose right now whether
we're gonna throw in the towel
or make a stand together.
Not as Firelights
or Jinxers
or washed-up goons.
- As Zaunites.
- We wanna see Jinx!
Where is Jinx?
Where is she?
We wanna see Jinx!
Yeah, where is she?
Yeah, where's Jinx?
You're all under arrest.
- Drop the blade.
- Drop it.
Drop the blade.
I'm back.
Time to find out who's
the new pebbleweight
Hmm? Isha?
Okay, I get it.
We're playing that game, are we?
Isha?
They got her.
What?
She came to the rally.
Topside raided the place.
Took everyone.
You know what you are.
- Damn it, Powder!
- Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up.
Stop calling me that.
Her name is Jinx.
She's my sister.
- Jinx.
- You have to be someone else.
Jinx.
Jinx.
Chin up, little one.
I'll tell you a secret.
We won't be staying long.
Don't suppose you can swim, huh, Lefty?
Well, only leaves the fun option.
I'm gonna hate this, aren't I?
Ha! It's me.
Your vile villainess.
The author of your nightmares.
The, uh, dread of your
Who are you?
Mm, Jinx?
Yeah, never heard that before.
You're not gonna haul me in?
Claim the prize? Be the big hero?
You expect me to believe
Jinx, the master criminal,
wears pants like that?
What's wrong with my pants?
You look like a half-eaten circus tent.
Ugh! I am Jinx.
"Half-eaten."
Can we focus?
Oh Oh, oh, oh
Let's go.
Whoo! Big mama.
How'd you take her in?
I gave her a choice between
this and a swim in the harbor.
Cell Block C. Carry on, officer.
Yes, sir.
Move it.
Come on, man. I have a kid.
You can't keep us in here.
Here I am,
your big fat hero.
You're late for Stink
Maw's great comeuppance.
What the hell was that?
Move it.
Stand down.
Get her out.
You really are a
Big fat hero.
You got me, hairball.
But just remember
you're no Stink Maw.
Smile.
Powder?

Following her abandonment by Caitlyn, Vi becomes heavily involved in an underground fighting ring as a coping mechanism and spends her spare time either drinking with Loris or alone in a grimy Zaun apartment. Her drinking gradually gets excessive, to the point that Loris has to help her to her apartment on one occasion; seeing a Piltover banner during this causes Vi to start having hallucinations of Caitlyn, ultimately causing her to attack a leery dance club patron she initially mistook for her. She and Loris argue and go their separate ways soon after this, further contributing to her negative mental state; she continues to get drunk alone, and her fighting abilities falter to the point she ends up getting repeatedly battered by her opponents in the fighting ring.

One evening, Vi wakes up to find Jinx in her apartment. Enraged, she grabs her estranged sister by the neck and pins her against the wall. Jinx tries to speak, but Vi coldly states that she does not want to hear another word from her. Struggling to breathe, Jinx claims that Vander is alive, but Vi dismisses her words as a lie and tightens her hold to the point Jinx starts to choke. After a couple of seconds, though, Vi notices Jinx shedding tears and lets her go; Jinx collapses to her knees and takes a moment to get her breath back before claiming Vander needs their help.

Within Stillwater Hold, Caitlyn, Ambessa, and the Enforcers inspect the carnage left behind by Warwick. Taking an elevator to the cell block where Singed, Isha, and the other protestors from Sevika's rally had been detained, Caitlyn observes the damage done, before spotting the trail of blood drops Singed had left to lead Warwick to the prison; following it leads her to his cell, still locked and occupied by the doctor.

Following her discovery, Caitlyn and Ambessa question Singed, as Caitlyn coldly states she had hoped to see an end to the monstrosities of Zaun after her and Ambessa's months-long campaign and occupation. She accuses Singed of deliberately summoning Warwick to the prison; Singed does not reply, prompting Ambessa to claim that only guilty men respond to accusations silently. In response, Singed claims that no one in power is innocent. Angered by his words, Caitlyn tells him of deep prison cells devoid of light, fresh air, and other basic human needs; she has forbidden their use until now, but she threatens to make an exception for Singed if he refuses to cooperate.

As Caitlyn delivers her threat, Ambessa picks up a compact that plays a musical lullaby when opened from among the doctor's possessions; after listening to it for a couple of seconds, she closes it and tells Singed to tell them how to track Warwick. Singed replies that his age has given him an abundance of patience; recognizing the refusal and seething with rage, Caitlyn warns the doctor that he is on his last chance and asks about his plan and how Jinx was involved. Singed remains unfazed by her threats, however, and a furious Caitlyn whispers that he will rot in prison before departing with Ambessa.

Elsewhere, Mel awakens within a large underground pit and panics as she recalls how the Black Rose kidnapped her and murdered Elora. After her panic subsides, she hears a man call out to her from elsewhere within the pit, with the man indicating himself to be a prisoner like her. Mel asks who he is, but the man claims to be unsure, remarking that their captors have a way of distorting their captives' minds. Mel then recalls Elora's murder, to which the man comments on how the "stewards of the old world" are always keen to provide glimpses of their might. He suggests the pit is an Oculorum, a supposed prison for false prophets built by ancient beings, though he adds that he considers them just fancy pits that "peacock princes" used to imprison each other. Recognizing the phrase "peacock princes", Mel tells the man to step into the light provided by the sky above; the man does so, and Mel recognizes him as her supposedly dead brother Kino. The man, in turn, recognizes Mel as his sister, and the two embrace.

In Zaun, Jinx and Isha lead Vi to an abandoned mine that Jinx claims to have followed Vander to before losing him. Along the way, Vi spots a mural depicting Jinx as a hero of Zaun in Vander's stead; she turns to Jinx, who merely nods at her to keep following. Entering the mine - populated with bioluminescent mushrooms that briefly brighten when loud noises are made nearby, lighting the trio's route - Vi questions why Vander would come to such a place. Still, Jinx has no answer, and Vi begins to dismiss her story about Vander as no more than one of her delusions. In response, Jinx assures Isha that Vi used to be "cooler" before she (Jinx) "kicked her butt", which Vi cites as proof of Jinx being delusional.

Goaded by her former sister's comment, Jinx states that she wishes seeing Vi working with the Enforcers - the same organization that killed their birth parents - was a delusion, to which Vi expresses gratitude that their parents never had to see the "psycho" Jinx became. Jinx retorts by asking which of the two siblings that description applies to, pointing out that she rescued Zaun's people from Stillwater while Vi was in her downward spiral before threatening to beat Vi again unless she keeps moving. Vi claims that Jinx would not last a second without her various gadgets, but Jinx points out Vi's own reliance on her Hextech Gauntlets, while also mocking her for not building them herself. Dropping the gauntlets, Vi claims she could beat Jinx without them, only to be interrupted when Jinx rushes forward and slaps her. Vi is left stunned, and Jinx soon declares herself to have lasted one second.

Enraged, Vi grabs and pulls on one of Jinx's braids, to which Jinx responds by tackling her to the ground and initiating a brawl. After Vi manages to reverse their positions, Isha tries to aid Jinx by jumping on top of Vi and biting her arm, causing Vi to elbow her in the face and give her a bloody nose. Both Vi and Jinx are left shocked when they realize Isha has been hurt, with Jinx abandoning the fight to check on her, much to Vi's surprise. After Isha indicates herself to be okay and continues through the mine, Vi asks Jinx why she came to get her, expressing doubt that she and Isha really needed her help. Jinx answers that their previous, separate attempts to help Vander drastically changed their lives, and suggests that the current situation could be a second chance for them. She also reminds Vi that Vander was father to them both; Vi responds by silently following after Isha, with Jinx shrugging and following them.

Within Stillwater, Ambessa visits Singed; the doctor claims to have been expecting her, remarking that those seeking a weapon always have the same look. Ambessa replies that she has never seen a beast like Warwick in all her years of battle, to which Singed remarks that no beast is more savage than man. He asks for Ambessa's terms; the Noxian presents him with the compact and tells him that in exchange for his aid and loyalty, she will provide him with all he needs for his research and treat him as an esteemed advisor. Singed takes the compact, signifying his acceptance of her deal, and Ambessa warns him that he will wish for the cells Caitlyn had threatened him with if he tests her.

Aware that Ambessa seeks to capture Warwick, Singed explains the beast's past as Vander, while within the mine, Warwick detects a bloody handprint left behind by Isha due to Vi and Jinx's fight. Singed adds that he used Vander's corpse as a test subject due to the man's great resilience, making more progress on his research than he could have done with any other specimen. He tried unsuccessfully to restore Vander's mind as part of his research, but it was lost to Warwick's feral instincts and bloodlust; having seen how Warwick reacted to Jinx during the earlier fight at Stillwater, though, he suspects she may be the catalyst needed to restore it. During this conversation, Warwick is shown experiencing more of Vander's memories, including one of Silco toasting him with the words "blisters and bedrock".

Later on, while Singed is carrying out research under Ambessa's supervision, he finds himself confronted by Caitlyn, who has deduced him to be responsible for the creation of Shimmer. She demands to know why he would develop such a thing, to which Singed shows her and Ambessa to a glass coffin containing the lifeless body of his daughter Orianna, explaining that all of his research has been for the purpose of bringing her back to life.

While exploring the mines, Vi, Jinx and Isha come across an abandoned hideout used by Vander and Silco prior to their failed rebellion against Piltover. There, Vi discovers a letter Vander had written to Silco, apologizing for his attempt to kill him and admitting he had been motivated by anger over Felicia's death. Reading the letter, Jinx laments that Silco never found it, imagining that he might have abandoned his attempt to kill Vander if he had. Vi reaches towards Jinx's shoulder as if to comfort her, but fails to go through with it, and the trio leave the hideout.

Shortly after leaving, the trio come across the frenzied Warwick, who charges at them with murderous intent. Ignoring Jinx's urgings for her not to fight, Vi attacks Warwick to protect the other two, beginning a fierce battle with the beast. Eventually, Warwick hits Vi with a powerful backhand; she blocks the worst of the blow, but the impact knocks her back and into a wall, and Warwick turns his attention to Isha. The sight of Jinx causes Vander's personality to emerge briefly, before Vi coughs up blood as a result of getting knocked into the wall, causing Warwick to fall back into his bloodlust and turn towards her. Vi raises her gauntlets to continue the fight, but Jinx insists that Warwick is Vander and pleads for Vi to believe her. Warwick then charges towards Vi, who lowers her hands and calls out Vander's name.

Hearing his former name causes Warwick to recall one of Vander's memories before Vi's birth. In the memory, Vander, Silco, and Felicia - Vi and Jinx's mother - are gathered within the Last Drop, with Felicia revealing that she is pregnant with Vi. She admits she has been struggling to decide on a name for her daughter, and expresses concern about whether she can be a good mother to her within the Undercity. However, she also shows hope for the future, noting how attentive Vander and Silco became after learning of her pregnancy. She asserts that they will figure out how their dream of establishing an independent Zaun for the sake of her and her daughter, even if they have to "carve it out of the bedrock or cover it in blisters."; Vander agrees with the sentiment, questioning what the point of Zaun would be if they could not raise a child there. Silco then leads the other two in a toast to Zaun, using the words "blisters and bedrock", after which Vander admits to Felicia that he has always liked the name "Violet".

In the present day, a terrified Jinx frantically ignites a lighter before she and Isha use it to look around the now dark mine. After several tense seconds, they spot Warwick's silhouette standing hunched over; when they get closer, they discover it to be Vi and Warwick embracing each other, Vander's personality having taken control. Noticing Jinx, Vi invites her to join the embrace, reminding her that Vander is also her father. Crying tears of relief, Jinx runs forward to do so, with Isha doing the same soon after.

Well, folks there he is,
the butterflyweight champion
of the Piltover Boxing League,
Gustove "The Scowler" Jowler!
Looking good, sis.
Wait, just
I don't wanna hear another
word out of your mouth.
It's Vander.
I'm not falling for
another one of your tricks.
He's
alive.
We both know that's bullshit.
He needs our help.
I can prove it.
Months of peacekeeping occupation.
Countless operations.
Oceans of sweat and tears.
I'd begun to think we might finally see
an end to Zaun's perverse abominations.
How foolish was I?
The beast came for you.
It was summoned by you.
In my experience,
only guilty men answer
accusations with silence.
In my experience,
no one in power is innocent.
There are cells buried
deep within this prison
so devoid of light
and fresh air and all
basic human considerations
that up till now, I
have forbidden their use.
If you do not want to waste away
the remainder of your days in one
of these, you have one recourse.
Tell us everything we need to
know to hunt down this beast.
Your youth betrays you.
Patience is a product of age.
Both of which I possess in abundance.
This is your final chance.
Tell me what you were planning.
How was Jinx involved?
You will rot in here.
Elora?
Black Rose.
Hope you find these
quarters to your liking.
They still haven't replied to my
requests for a transfer.
Who's there?
Not sure I know anymore.
Our hosts have a way of
scrambling your omelet.
They killed my friend.
Elora was there.
And then
Elora!
Ah. The stewards of the old world
are always keen to give you
a glimpse of their might.
What is this place?
Near as I can tell,
an Oculorum.
According to legend,
the ancients built specialized
chambers to seal away false prophets.
But if you ask me,
they're just the fancy pits
peacock princes like to
toss their friends into.
Peacock princes?
Sorry, just an old family joke.
You know, the kind of rulers
with an artistic flair.
Step into the light.
Kino?
It's me, brother.
Mel.
Mel.
You've grown up.
I'd hoped they'd never come for you.
This is where I lost him.
Cool, huh?
Not even toxic.
Pretty sure.
Why would Vander be
all the way down here?
Beats me.
Ask him yourself.
When will you admit that this
is just one of your fantasies?
Or do you not want the kid to
know how delusional you are?
She wasn't always like this.
She actually used to be pretty
cool, before I kicked her butt.
See what I mean?
Delusional.
Wish I was just seeing
things when you decided
to throw in with the Piltie
goons who murdered Mom and Dad.
At least they never had to see the
psycho their daughter turned into.
Which one?
Wake up, sis.
I'm a hero.
I busted half of Zaun out of Stillwater
while you were passed out
in the bottom of a mug.
Now can it and keep walking,
before I kick your ass again.
You wouldn't last one second
without all your ugly gadgets
and chickenshit tricks.
Ha! What about those
overdesigned bitch-mittens
you didn't even build yourself?
You think I need these to ?
There. One second.
Last chance to surrender.
Go right ahead, fat hands.
Hey, kid.
Still got all your insides?
Mm.
But don't ditch us.
Why'd you come get me?
You don't actually need my help.
You haven't for a long time.
Last time Vander needed
us, we tried it alone,
and nothing was ever the same.
So
maybe this is like a do-over.
Besides,
he's your father too.
I've been expecting you.
Confident, aren't you?
It's always the same look
when one covets a weapon.
I've fought battles from the
Bloodcliffs to the Dalamor Plain.
I've never seen a
beast of such savagery.
No beast is more savage than man.
I trust you have terms.
You will serve me.
My enemies will be yours.
Your weapons will be mine.
In return, I will supply all your needs.
You will be treated
as an esteemed adviser.
But I demand absolute loyalty.
Do not test this,
or you will yearn for
Caitlyn's dungeons.
You already know what I want.
He isn't a monster.
He was once a man.
Well respected, at that.
Victim of great tragedy.
He had a ferocious will to live.
An incredible tolerance for pain.
With him,
I was able to make strides
impossible with any other specimen.
But the mind
The mind I could not recover.
The man forever lost in
the bowels of the beast,
compelled only by the scent of blood.
Or so I thought.
It now seems I had yet to
uncover the right catalyst.
Blisters and bedrock.
There was a funeral for you in Noxus.
Oh. Did Mother commission a statue?
I held rites in Piltover.
She believes you're dead.
I do like to disappoint her.
How did you know to do that?
I don't know.
I just felt
It's like some sort of puzzle.
Kino, what happened to you?
How did you wind up here?
She didn't tell you.
After a few rounds with some
dubious noblefolk in Basilich,
I started hearing strange
rumors about Mother.
Different than the usual kind.
They said, many years ago,
she passed through their hometown and
fell in love.
That's not our mother.
Indeed.
But the more I inquired, the
more I started believing it.
The old travel logs.
The local accounts.
I should have left it alone, but
The affair led to a child.
That's impossible.
It is the reason we are here.
Simply put,
whatever that child inherited is
of terrible interest to our captors.
This will allow you
to locate your beast?
Not precisely.
My family archives have shed light
on many of this city's mysteries.
Commander.
General.
One such mystery caught my attention.
The curious dismissal of a
revered academy alchemist.
Unparalleled, by all accounts.
And no mention of his crime.
This led to one other
missing puzzle piece
whose absence has
always gnawed at my mind.
Who invented Shimmer?
We have our answer now,
don't we, Dr. Reveck?
You're a monster.
Why?
Why do all this?
Why does anyone commit
acts others deem unspeakable?
For love.
Perhaps,
in another life
you would have been friends.
Everything I've done is to cure her.
I believe the beast
may hold the final key.
Precisely what are you trying to cure?
That affliction we all suffer.
Death.
Imagine a world that
no longer need fear it.
- Mel?
- I'm getting us out of here.
Hmm.
Say this is some sort
of sordid labyrinth.
Usually there are consequences
for someone who fails these tests.
Deadly consequences.
I deserve to know the truth.
Of course.
Makes you wonder why she kept
this from you, doesn't it?
For all these years?
I'm missing something.
A healthy sense
of self-preservation, I'd say.
You aren't my brother.
Who are you? What have
you done with Kino?
We had such high hopes for him.
At first, it seemed plausible
that he could have been the child.
But then your mother
led us to you.
Sister.
What is it?
A message from Vander.
To Silco.
- "Silco, I've looked everywhere, but "
- I've looked everywhere, but
it's clear you don't wanna be found.
God, I'm shit at this.
I'm sorry.
When she died, I lost my head.
I told myself what I did to
you was for the greater good,
that you deserved it.
But the dirt was on both our hands.
Anyway, you know where to find me.
Blisters and bedrock.
V.
If he found this,
everything might have been different.
We have to get out of here.
It's him. It's Vander.
- That's not Vander.
- It is.
Something's got him riled up.
No, Vander, no.
It's me.
He's gonna kill you.
Don't hurt him.
Hark!
Vi, it's him.
You have to believe me.
Vander!
What's the occasion?
Hmm. Can't a lady just
be in the mood for a familiar song?
Not this lady, and not this song.
Tonight a harebrained scheme
these two bozos cooked up
to turn a dank crack in the earth
into a thriving, healthy community
became a reality.
Tonight, eh?
You hear that, Bozo 2?
We made it. We're done.
Oh, you're sadly mistaken.
I'm Bozo 1.
A night of revelations.
I'm knocked up.
- A girl.
- How do you know?
Mm. Wasn't really part of my plan,
but guess that's everything
when you're living week to week.
What did Connol say?
I haven't told him.
Working up the nerve.
I don't know anything about kids.
I get sweaty being alone with one.
Hey, you're gonna be a great mother.
Shut up.
I'm not ready for that.
I started trying to come up with a name,
and it hits me that this one word
is a decision she's gonna
live with her whole life.
I can't protect her from
all the shit down here
and work out how to be a
parent at the same time.
Then I realized,
I don't have to.
Hmm? Why's that?
Because the second I told you,
I put you on the hook.
You two are gonna figure
this Zaun thing out.
I don't care if you have to
carve it out of the bedrock,
covered in blisters.
You're not allowed to fail anymore.
For her.
For me.
What's the point if we can't
raise an ankle biter or two?
To Zaun, then.
Blisters and bedrock.
I've always liked the name Violet.
What are you waiting for?
He's your dad too.
Salo?
What are you doing here?
Jayce.
One could ask the same question.
How are you walking?
Who do you think could
mend such a broken creature?
Would you want to speak with him?
Jayce.
I'd feared I wouldn't have the
chance to speak with you again.
Viktor?
I would prefer to converse in person.
But there's so much work to be done.
How are you doing this?
I suppose this is somewhat
beyond where we left off.
Is Salo still in there?
Where else would I be?
You have my solemn vow
that anything you discuss will be
kept in the strictest confidence.
I owe Viktor
everything.
Very kind, Salo.
I have so many breakthroughs
to share with you, Jayce.
I thought you were done with Hextech.
And me.
I was clouded by emotions.
Come. Visit me.
See what I've accomplished.
I've helped so many.
You've given Hextech to the people?
As we always promised we would.
Viktor has truly worked wonders.
Hextech isn't a miracle.
It's a curse.
We have to end it, Viktor.
We have to.
You seem different.
Something happened.
Now I see it.
You, too, have touched the Arcane.
Your mind suffered.
If you'll excuse me,
I must return to him.
I can't let you leave.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I'm sorry too.

Vi, Jinx, Isha, and Warwick travel to Viktor's commune, hoping he can cure Warwick. They encounter Huck at the commune entrance, whereupon Vi accuses him of being a traitor due to him previously selling out her and Caitlyn to Silco. Huck admits that Vi saw him at his worst back then, before claiming that Viktor has cured him of his past self. He then insists that Vi's group turn over their weapons, claiming the commune to be a place of peace; Jinx responds by drawing her pistol on him, but relents after Vi drops her Hextech gauntlets. As the group heads into the commune, Isha pockets the Hextech Gemstones used to power the gauntlets.

When presented with Warwick, Viktor attempts to delve into his mind, finding Vander enshrined within Warwick's feral nature. Despite an initial lack of success and a warning from Sky that his power may not be enough to save Vander, Viktor agrees to see what he can do, on the condition that Warwick be restrained at night. Over the next few days, he and Sky gradually begin to unravel Vander from Warwick, awakening more of Vander's memories of Vi and his other loved ones.

Around the same time that Viktor finds success with Warwick, Ambessa, Rictus, Singed, Caitlyn, and Ambessa's soldiers arrive at the commune. Huck's attempts to deny the armed group entry are met with Ambessa silently ordering Rictus to advance on him, before Singed deescalates the situation by offering to head into the commune and speak with Viktor, having deduced him to be the true identity of the commune's Herald. Ambessa agrees to let him go, but has her troops prepare to move on the commune that night.

Singed finds Viktor within Warwick's quarters of the commune, where Viktor is unsuccessfully attempting to heal Warwick further. The older man remarks that Viktor's power is not unlimited, but nevertheless marvels at his former pupil's transformation. Referring to Viktor and Warwick as the apexes of Hextech and Shimmer, the doctor proposes that Viktor use Warwick's blood to save himself, adding that such a thing would bring humanity closer to being free of death. While sympathetic to his goal, Viktor notes that such a thing would kill Vander, whom he sees as a man instead of a mere specimen. Unwilling to forsake a man who needs his help, Viktor declines the doctor's proposition and dismisses him. Singed agrees to leave, but warns Viktor that if he dies, his commune will likely perish with him.

As Singed departs, Vi spots him leaving and tails him into the rock formations surrounding the commune. As she does so, Caitlyn - who initially does not recognize her - ambushes and takes her down before identifying her as her former comrade. Both women exchange barbs, before Vi notices Noxian soldiers in the surrounding area. She asks Caitlyn about them, to which Caitlyn explains her and Ambessa's mission to capture Warwick before asking Vi why she came to the formations. Vi tells her of her attempt to save Vander, which causes Caitlyn to realize he and Warwick are the same individual.

Within the Noxian camp, Singed tells Ambessa about Viktor's intention of saving Vander, and warns her that such a thing would render them unable to make use of Warwick. Ambessa states they will have to force Viktor's hand, and Singed offers to use a concoction of his to inhibit Viktor's efforts. Their conversation is then interrupted when Caitlyn enters the tent with a handcuffed Vi, now sporting a bruise on her left cheek. Elsewhere, Jayce approaches the commune from a nearby canyon.

Vi is chained to a post within Ambessa's tent; she snarls and spits at Caitlyn, who silently wipes the spittle off her face while giving her former comrade a cold look. Ambessa then dispatches her and Singed into the commune to attend to Warwick, Caitlyn leaving her rifle in the tent as she departs. As this happens, Jinx observes Warwick's quarters from the roof of a nearby building, before spotting Isha sneaking into the commune. The younger girl joins Jinx on the roof and hands over her shock pistol, having smuggled it past Viktor's followers; taking the pistol back, Jinx admits that taking care of Isha has given her a new perspective on life. She then spots Singed and Caitlyn approaching Warwick, and levels her pistol at them.

In her camp, Ambessa talks to the restrained Vi about Caitlyn's past feelings for her, before thanking her for creating a vulnerability in Caitlyn's heart that Ambessa was able to exploit. She admits that she would have considered recruiting Vi to work for her under different circumstances, before picking up a dagger and indicating that she sees the other woman as a potential distraction for Caitlyn. Vi replies that Caitlyn is not distracted, and tells Ambessa of three things Vander told her to do to win a person's trust. The first was to be honest, which she uses as an excuse to insult the Noxian. The second was to be patient; she admits to having trouble with this but notes that being tied up helps with it. Ambessa then asks what the third thing is, to which Vi replies, "Just shut... the fuck... up."

Looking over at Caitlyn's discarded rifle, Ambessa notices that it is missing its net projectile. Recalling that it was also gone when Caitlyn left the rifle in the tent earlier, she realizes that Caitlyn has tricked and betrayed her just as Vi finishes picking the lock to her cuffs. Furious, the general throws her dagger at Vi, who dodges the blade before pulling out the missing net projectile and throwing it into the air. As it descends, a flashback reveals that Caitlyn had agreed to help Vi rescue Vander soon after subduing her, providing information about Ambessa's patrols within the area to allow Vander to be smuggled out of the commune. Vi's supposed capture and handover was done to have her serve as a distraction to Ambessa and the other Noxians; to that end, Caitlyn gave her the net projectile from her rifle, and Vi had Caitlyn hit her on her left cheek to sell the ruse that she had been taken captive, before allowing Caitlyn to cuff her and bring her to Ambessa.

As the flashback finishes, Vi punches the net projectile at Ambessa, setting it off and causing it to restrain her against a table before electrocuting her into unconsciousness. Within the commune, Jinx - whom Vi had informed of her plan beforehand - watches as Caitlyn puts Singed into a stranglehold and chokes him out before he can inject Warwick with his serum. As this happens, Vi mockingly expresses hope that she was worth Ambessa's time, before taking Caitlyn's rifle as the general passes out.

With Singed subdued, Caitlyn kneels next to Warwick and tells him she has come to help him. Before he can respond, Rictus suddenly appears and grabs Caitlyn by the neck, intending to strangle her to death for her betrayal of Ambessa. Jinx however comes to Caitlyn's rescue and briefly fights Rictus; he proves too much to handle for her though, using magic-absorbing runes on his glaive to counter her Hextech-powered shock pistol before grabbing one of her braids and pinning her to the ground. He raises his glaive to finish her, but Warwick dashes in front of him and blocks the blow with his body. Speaking in Vander's voice, he coldly tells the comparatively smaller Rictus not to touch his daughter before bodily throwing him through a window of the building.

As Caitlyn recovers, she sees Jinx embracing Warwick and angrily calls out to her. Jinx pays her little mind however, and Vi and Isha enter the room moments later, allowing Caitlyn to see the two sisters have reconciled. Vi gives Caitlyn an apologetic look, before she, Jinx, Warwick and Isha enjoy a happy reunion, Vander seemingly saved.

Elsewhere in the commune, Jayce is bought to Viktor's quarters by one of the residents, whereupon he uses his Mercury Hammer to blast his former partner in the chest, seemingly killing him. As a result of this, Viktor's followers let out screams before collapsing dead, the noise causing Vi, Caitlyn, Jinx and Isha to emerge from Warwick's quarters to investigate the disturbance. Moments after they leave, Warwick reverts back to his feral personality, implied to be the result of losing Viktor's calming influence/Singed managing to inject him with his serum while the others were distracted. With Vander once again lost, Warwick bursts out of the building while crying tears of lava, before spotting the recovering Rictus and mauling him to death. Immediately after this, the rest of Vi and Caitlyn's group spot Ambessa watching them from nearby; enraged at both Rictus's death and Caitlyn's betrayal, the Noxian has her soldiers charge at them.

As the Noxians begin their attack, Viktor delivers a monologue about humanity being a weakness, seeing it as a supposed "message hidden within the pattern". Within the commune, Vi is wounded by a Noxian glaive while trying to stop Ambessa's soldiers from slaying Warwick, prompting Caitlyn to come to her aid. Jinx meanwhile attempts to calm Warwick, but he knocks her down with a powerful backhand. Seeing Jinx on the ground and Vi injured, Isha picks up Jinx's dropped shock pistol and loads the two Hextech Gemstones she pocketed earlier into it, before running towards Warwick, recalling memories of the time she and Jinx spent together as she does so. Jinx realizes that Isha intends to sacrifice herself to save the others, and desperately calls out to her in an attempt to stop her, before Vi restrains her to keep her from getting close to the girl. Taking up a position next to Warwick, Isha smiles and makes a gunshot gesture at Jinx as a farewell, before aiming the shock pistol into the sky and pulling the trigger, setting off a devastating explosion.

Following this, Viktor concludes that humanity can inspire people to do both great good and great evil.

I see it now.
I can't let you leave.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I'm sorry too.
Poor Salo.
That isn't Jayce.
But there is another
will at work within him.
I thought I heard something
just before the portal closed.
Ancient, like a
Like a voice.
This is a sophisticated conjuration.
A singularity,
simultaneously self-replicating
and self-annihilating.
We've never seen complexity like this.
Flawless
exquisite
chaos.
Noxus prizes strength above all else,
defining it by three core principles.
Vision.
The top of the triangle.
Charting a course, and having
the wisdom to navigate it.
This form is your base, child.
Your eyes see what others don't.
Might.
Bending your environment to your will.
Your speed is improving.
But eventually you need force.
Too much force exposes you to risk.
Indeed.
The last is guile.
Phantoms.
Tricksters.
Mages.
Absent honor.
Absent accountability.
Remember this, Caitlyn.
Tunnels in your eyes.
Lava in your veins.
Shadows in your heart.
This is the truth of combat.
I've discovered a fourth principle.
One that heightens all others.
Sacrifice.
The temper born of suffering.
We understand it as others cannot.
We are kin.
Pardon the interruption.
I've tracked him to Zaun.
Let's hunt a beast.
Vi.
I hoped you might return.
You filthy traitor.
Yes.
That was me at my worst.
Simply awful.
But the Herald has
freed me of my past self.
He's given me a chance to make amends.
- Excuse me. Some water?
- All are welcome.
But I must ask you to
surrender your weapons.
This is a place of peace.
Ugh.
Hm.
Welcome, you two.
Hello, friend.
Would you like some fruit?
The Herald's vision.
Come, he's expecting you.
We hear you can heal people.
Viktor.
You once told me, all
systems have limits.
He is worth the risk.
Vander's psyche is deeply
entangled with that of the beast.
How did you know his name?
He told me.
Ask for a miracle healer,
get a metal fortune cookie.
I saw your father.
His dream of your family and vision
of Zaun as it could have been,
it was
beautiful.
Cookie.
Can you help him?
I will do all in my power.
Hmm. Hmm?
However, I have one condition.
Looks like you got a couple.
You have much to offer
this commune, Powder.
Your talents can be used to
build, instead of destroy.
I'll stick with what I know, thanks.
My condition is that he
must be restrained at night.
I've seen the harm of
which he is capable.
What do you think?
You actually want my opinion?
I hate fortune cookies.
We're gonna get you
out of there, Vander.
- My girls.
- Pow-Pow, come here.
Do you remember them?
I remember Mom's smell the most.
- Axle grease.
- Axle grease.
This place.
Do you think it could actually work?
Underground utopia, run by
a skinny tin Machine Herald.
Maybe when Piltover
slides into the sump.
What if we stayed?
Helped them out?
"We"?
Forward!
Halt.
No weapons.
I'm afraid the Herald insists.
If I may.
I believe this Herald may
be a former pupil of mine.
A man of science.
Let me speak with him.
Hmm.
Ready our forces for tonight.
I should like to meet this Herald.
You've felt it, haven't you?
Your decline?
Your power is finite,
diminished by every use.
I've been expecting you, doctor.
Viktor.
Incredible.
What I wouldn't give to glimpse
the world through your eyes.
To know what you know.
His quest led him astray
of any trodden path.
His own shadow dissolved to darkness.
Now the only course was forward.
The only warmth, a dream of her waltz.
Knowledge is a paradox.
The more one understands,
the more one realizes the
vastness of his ignorance.
Marvelous specimen, isn't he?
The regenerative qualities of
his blood will stabilize you.
Apex Shimmer combined with you,
the apex form of Hextech.
What you are suggesting
would destroy him.
And for what?
Conquest?
The greed of warmongers?
To complete your work.
To save us from ourselves.
You must survive, Viktor.
Do you believe in fate, doctor?
Our paths carved before us.
Guided by an invisible hand?
Not fate, evolution.
Nature's greatest
force, forever in flux.
No.
Evolution has a destination.
Not to combat nature,
but to supersede it.
The final, glorious evolution.
But he isn't a specimen.
He's a man.
And he needs my help.
I will not sacrifice his
humanity for your cause.
You may leave.
Very well.
But I assume you understand already,
if you perish, this
community is soon to follow.
On the job, I see.
You can't be here.
Oh. Here, like where I landed
when this rich, unhinged
mongoose just tackled me?
Mongoose?
Your hair.
You look like an angry oil slick.
Don't sugarcoat it, cupcake.
The routes in and out of this canyon
are being monitored.
No one can come in or out
without being questioned.
Who's out there?
We tracked some sort of
new chemweapon down here.
A bloodthirsty murderous beast.
What are you doing here?
Trying to save my dad.
Viktor believes he can save
the man inside the beast.
If he succeeds, I'm afraid
the creature's usefulness
will be lost to us.
Then we'll have to force his hand.
I believe I can craft a serum that
will prohibit Viktor's success.
Make sure it's secured.
Yes?
It's Vi.
So much for happy reunions.
Well done, Caitlyn.
It's time.
We have scouts up now, sir.
Six, collectively.
Slippery as an eel.
I knew you could get it.
Had some time to think lately.
Ever since you dropped into my
life, it's like I put on glasses.
Except I can't tell whether
everything's blurry or clear.
Wanna hear a dumb joke?
A sentimental ex-con, a giant furball,
and two of Piltover's most
wanted walk into a weird cult.
And here comes the punch line.
Vi.
You've been quite a curiosity.
One who captured Caitlyn's heart.
I owe you thanks.
Your absence provided a
vacuum I was able to fill.
In other circumstances,
I might have offered you
a position in my organization.
Your resilience is undeniable.
Of course, that won't be possible.
You cause too many complications.
Caitlyn must not be distracted.
Don't worry, she's not distracted.
You know, my father
taught me about trust.
He told me if I wanted it, there
were three things I needed to do:
Be honest, even if it means
telling a self-righteous windbag
that her breath smells like a cesspool.
Be patient.
Mm, still haven't cracked that
one, but being tied up sure helps.
And the third?
Just shut the fuck up.
The fissures are
blocked by guard towers.
Patrols circle the
commune at even intervals.
Her personal guard are
posted here, here and here.
They aren't expecting trouble at home.
With flawless timing and luck and
A big distraction.
Whatever you do,
don't underestimate Ambessa.
Vander's in trouble.
I have a plan.
You're not gonna like it.
Hope I was worth your time.
I won't
I won't fail.
Vi sent me.
I'm going to get you out of here.
Ambessa believed in you.
Your death will be a deep cut.
Don't touch my daughter.
You.
I won't fail.
I swear it.
Vander.
I understand now.
The message hidden within the pattern.
The reason for our
failures in the commune.
The doctor was right.
It's inescapable.
Humanity.
Our very essence.
Our emotions
Rage.
Compassion.
Hate.
Two sides of the same coin.
Inextricably bound.
Vander, wait.
Pew!
Boo!
No!
Pew!
Isha!
That which inspires us
to our greatest good
is also the cause of our greatest evil.

---

Ekko and Hiemerdinger possess their versions in a timeline where the heist on Jayce's lab went very differently, resulting in Vi being killed and the rest being captured by wardens. This leads to Hextech never being invented, Powder never becoming Jinx, Vander and Silco reconciling and co-running the bar, and Mylo and Claggor being alive. In this timeline, Piltover and Zaun (which is now a vibrant arcology instead of a slum) are at peace, with free movement and commerce between them, and Ekko and Powder are academy students and dating. Hiemerdinger and Ekko, with Powder's help (although without letting her know about the temporal displacement), utilize a fragment of the hex crystal taken from the ruins of Jayce's lab to create a time-reversal device. They eventually find a way to separate Ekko from his alternate self and send him back. This effort appears to vaporize Heimerdinger, but it is unclear if this kills him as he is a Yordle. Powder sees the restored alternate Ekko vanish while cradling the Ekko from this timeline, who is unconscious on the ground from the separation.

Jayce is sent into a ruined possible future, where he wanders alone for an indeterminate amount of time, chasing signs of the cloaked figure from his childhood. This future is the result of Victor succeeding in carrying out his Glorious Evolution, with all life converted to perfect mechanical dolls, which do not need to do anything and stand immobile among the ruins of the world. Jayce breaks his leg, rigs up a mechanical brace for it, and eventually tracks the cloaked figure to the top of the central clock tower. We do not hear what passes between them at this time. Still, Jayce promises to fix things by going back in time to stop Victor and takes a mutated hammer from what is presumed to be his converted body before being sent back to his encounter with Salo in the Hexvault.

---

Following the battle within Viktor's commune, Ambessa oversees the burials of Rictus and her other fallen warriors near the remains of the community, while Singed sets up an arrangement of tubes connecting Warwick and Viktor's motionless bodies, the latter of which is now contained within a spherical cocoon of Viktor's design. Ambessa mounts Rictus's weapon above his grave herself, and takes the magic-nullifying runes he had previously wielded against Amara and Jinx. As she does this, Singed can be heard expressing regret at being unable to save Rictus, to which Ambessa replies that a warrior's death should be avenged rather than lamented.

Following the burials, Ambessa asks Singed about Viktor's status. Singed explains that he can keep Viktor alive for a short time through transfusions of blood from Warwick, but his survival will ultimately be a matter decided by his willpower. Ambessa claims that Singed had promised her a cure to death, but Singed replies that such an outcome is dependant on Viktor's survival.

As Ambessa approaches Viktor's cocoon, Viktor's voice - now possessing a robotic register - addresses Singed, commending the doctor for his ingenuity. As he speaks, the cocoon and the markings on his deceased followers light up, before the previously dead Huck gets to his feet, Viktor possessing his body. Speaking through Huck, Viktor claims the world he sees is more lucid than ever. Ambessa questions his apparent ability to inhabit his followers, to which the followers simultaneously reply in Viktor's voice that they are one, before declaring themselves to be the Glorious Evolution that Viktor previously spoke of to Singed.

Viktor then claims that he is dying, before speaking of the anomaly beneath the Hexgates, which he believes can complete the transformation Singed initiated with the blood transfusion. Ambessa asks if the process will grant him the ability to evolve others; Viktor replies that it could, but with the damage done to him by Jayce's attack, he will not be able to reach the anomaly through the defense that will inevitably be raised against him. Ambessa offers to get him to the anomaly in exchange for him evolving her soldiers, with Viktor accepting the offer. He then places his hands to his temples and strains, whereupon Huck levitates off the ground and begins to glow. Ambessa looks upon the sight with amazement, while Singed takes a step forward.

Meanwhile, an unconscious Vi has a vision in which Caitlyn crouches over her body while expressing concern for her, before Jayce comes over and states that the group need to escape. She then has another vision of the bloodthirsty Warwick and Jinx's failed attempt to prevent Isha from sacrificing herself to stop the beast, before waking up to find herself in Caitlyn's bed at the Kiramman residence, with Loris sitting nearby. Initially mistaking him for Vander, Vi asks him what happened to Caitlyn and Jinx; Loris hesitates regarding the latter, claiming Caitlyn wanted to tell Vi herself, but Vi insists that Loris tell her.

Elsewhere in the building, Caitlyn and Maddie are looking over a map of Piltover and the surrounding area, with Ambessa's fleet marked as being positioned nearby. Maddie suggests they may be able to negotiate with Ambessa, but Caitlyn is certain her former mentor will stop at nothing to destroy Piltover after being betrayed by her. Maddie tries to comfort Caitlyn by encouraging her not to blame herself, but Caitlyn pulls away from her and states she needs a plan, rather than consolation.

The discussion is then interrupted by the arrival of Vi, who has learned from Loris that Jinx was arrested following the battle. Caitlyn dismisses Maddie from the room with an instruction to check on her father; Maddie leaves with an unhappy look on her face. With Maddie gone, Vi and Caitlyn argue over the events at the commune; Vi calls out Caitlyn for her apparent ingratitude towards Jinx - suspecting her of having the other woman arrested - while Caitlyn calls out Vi for not telling her of Jinx's involvement in their plan to rescue Vander, guessing correctly that Vi had employed her as a contingency against Caitlyn betraying them due to being unable to trust her. Vi defends her lack of trust by reminding Caitlyn of her past association with Ambessa, accusing her of happily swallowing the Noxian's words; Caitlyn angrily states her awareness of this, stunning Vi into silence.

With Vi having gone quiet, Caitlyn explains that rather than having her arrested, Jinx had surrendered to her after the group escaped from the commune; by the time Caitlyn was able to think about what had happening, Jinx had been taken away. She explains that Jinx is currently being held prisoner in the bunker until Caitlyn can decide her fate, with the commander indicating that she had been waiting for Vi to recover before making her decision. Vi pleads that her sister has changed, but Caitlyn insists that people cannot simply erase their mistakes. In response, Vi asks who gets to decide who should be given a second chance before exiting the room, leaving Caitlyn to contemplate things silently.

Following the argument, Caitlyn brings a tray of food to the cell containing Jinx, who has stopped eating and become despondent over the loss of Isha. Guessing that Caitlyn has come to execute her, Jinx tells the other woman to make sure of her death afterwards, and dismisses Vi's claim that she has changed when Caitlyn brings it up. Caitlyn asks that Jinx account for her actions, before admitting that she has hated the person she turned into over the hatred she felt for Jinx, and she no longer has the energy to continue doing so. She turns to leave, and Jinx - while admitting that knowing likely would not have stopped her - tells her that she had no idea Caitlyn's mother was in the Piltover Council's meeting room when she attacked the place following Silco's death.

Meanwhile, Mel returns to Piltover following her escape from the Black Rose's clutches. She enters the Piltover Council's meeting room, where she finds Jayce recalling the aftermath of Jinx's attack. The Hextech inventor guesses that Mel was responsible for keeping the the two of them from getting killed on that day; Mel confirms such, but claims her magic abilities only awoke then, and that she has yet to fully understand them. Still shaken by his time in the other timeline, Jayce demands to know why Mel only saved him; Mel insists she did not consciously decide to do so, but Jayce proceeds to question her honesty, accusing her of using him and Viktor for the sake of advancing Hextech. Mel replies that she valued the two men for their shared dreams and their abilities to do the impossible with Hextech; as she speaks, Jayce has more haunting visions, causing him to become agitated. He then raises his Mercury Hammer and fires a blast at one of the meeting room's support columns.

Following this, a slender, humanoid, white and gold mechanical construct descends from the room's rafters and approaches the pair. Viktor is shown to be controlling the construct, which is implied to be the transformed Huck; speaking through it, he addresses Jayce, saying that the two of them must talk. Jayce questions how the construct was able to get into the meeting room, to which Viktor reminds him that he once helped Jayce sneak into the same building, and laments being unable to show him the merits of "their" work during their previous meetings. Jayce dismisses Viktor's transformed followers as solely the result of the other man's obsession and attacks the construct with his hammer; the construct dodges his attacks before flying into the air, whereupon Viktor claims that he is no longer alone, and that he speaks with the voices of all his followers.

Jayce demands that Viktor say his intended message, but Viktor suggests that the other man already knows he seeks the anomaly in order to complete his mission. He warns that while he hopes to do so without conflict, "the Noxian" has other intentions, leading to Mel deducing that he and Ambessa are working together. In response, the construct darts behind Mel with superhuman speed; she turns around and projects a shield of magical light between them, only for the construct to extend a hand and start pushing through it. Jayce fires a blast from his hammer at it, causing it to break off his attack and turn away from Mel, whereupon he urges Viktor to stay away from the Hexgates for everyone's sake. He then attempts to strike down the construct again, but it easily dodges the blow, and Viktor claims that Jayce's mind has become rigid, his judgement clouded with fear. He reminds the other man of his role in starting this chain of events, before declaring the Glorious Evolution to be "destined", and asking that Jayce work with him as a partner once again.

In response, Jayce declares that his partner died in the room, to which Viktor replies that he had sincerely hoped to avoid this. Jayce then tries to take down the construct once again, but it evades his attacks with superhuman speed and agility, before subduing him, disarming him, and attempting to choke him into unconsciousness. Just as Jayce is about to pass out, Mel manages to use her magic to restrain the construct and make it break its hold, allowing Jayce to retrieve his hammer and then destroy the construct with a point blank blast. He then catches Mel as the exertions from using her magic call her to collapse, while a shaken Viktor tells Singed to begin the process.

Within her cell, Jinx is idly rolling a Hexgem around when she imagines herself being approached by Silco. Jinx tells her deceased father figure that he is too late, and Silco comments on how the late Marcus once had Vi imprisoned in Stillwater as a supposed merciful alternative to killing her. Jinx denies killing is mercy, prompting Silco to remark on the spark of rebellion still inside her despite everything before agreeing with her words. He claims that killing is a cycle, one that started long before his and Vander's time and will continue long after Jinx and Vi pass on. Jinx claims to be done with running in circles, and Silco states that people build their own prisons; oaths, codes, commitments, self-doubt, and accepted limitations that define their identities. He tells Jinx that he once thought he could escape his own such prison by fighting Piltover, but now believes that the only way to end the cycle is to find the will to walk away.

After the apparation of Silco disappears - along with the Hexgem Jinx had been playing with, suggesting it too was a figment of her imagination - Vi approaches the cell. Revealing to Jinx that she previously stole the cell's keys, she offers to help her sister escape, suggesting the two could use her talents and drive to "rewrite [her] story" just as Jinx did in Zaun. Jinx half-heartedly accepts the offer, and Vi enters the cell and embraces her. Remarking that her sister will never give up on her, Jinx punches Vi in the chest, stunning her, before escaping the cell and locking Vi inside. As Vi reacts with shock, Jinx tells the older woman to stop worrying about her and not feel guilty about being happy, before encouraging her to be with Caitlyn. She then walks away, claiming there is no good version of her; when Vi asks what she intends to do, Jinx claims only that she will "break the cycle", leaving Vi distraught.

Jayce and Mel have the Piltover Council and their families gather in the Piltover Council's meeting room, with Sevika and Scar attending as representatives of Zaun. There, Jayce displays the remains of the mechanical soldier of Viktor's he and Mel fought with, and reveals that Ambessa is planning to attack Piltover with hundreds more constructs like them in order to reach the Hexgates, with the consequences of her victory being the end of humanity itself. He urges those gathered to help him fight her, or to at least get as far away from Piltover as possible, prompting Sevika, Scar and some of the other attendees to depart. Other citizens of Piltover - and some from Zaun - agree to help, and the city makes preparations to mount a defense at the Hexgates.

Within the bunker, Vi hears approaching footsteps, and looks around to see Caitlyn at the cell door. The commander admits she had expected to find Vi here and enters the cell, whereupon a broken Vi states she believed Jinx would help. Turning away, she tells Caitlyn to berate her, citing her various mistakes - trusting Jinx, going behind Caitlyn's back, and consistently making wrong choices - before claiming to have lost everyone as a result of them. Caitlyn however approaches her and asks if Vi really thought she needed all the guards stationed at the Hexgates, causing Vi to look at her in shock as she comes to a realization: Caitlyn had deliberately altered the guard assignments to provide her with an opportunity to rescue Jinx, effectively giving the other woman her blessing to save her sister.

As Vi takes in the reveal, a smiling Caitlyn teases her for being predictable. Overcome with relief and love, Vi lunges forward and passionately kisses the other woman, with Caitlyn quickly responding in kind. Before long, Vi removes Caitlyn's jacket, at which point Caitlyn breaks the kiss and nervously admits to her fling with Maddie. Still overjoyed at Caitlyn's previous revelation, Vi happily assures her that she doesn't care; she proceeds to resume the kiss, and the two women ultimately go on to make love within the cell.

Meanwhile, Mel makes her way over to what was previously Viktor's commune to confront her mother. Upon entering the tent where Ambessa is sheltering, she takes off her hood and reveals herself. Although Ambessa initially looks joyed to see her alive, her happiness quickly fades into shock followed by defensiveness as Mel reveals she's aware of the Black Rose. Ambessa tries to downplay Mel's intelligence by telling her the Black Rose is little more than a facade, a corrupted lie, to which Mel responds by reciting her mother's words to her, saying 'The best lies come wrapped in truth.'

Mel asks Ambessa why The Black Rose killed Kino anyway, and she specified that Kino was so infatuated with the Order, and it ended up being his undoing. Mel disapproves of the vagueness of this answer and accuses Ambessa of letting him die, to which Ambessa responds by slapping her and reminding her of the hardships motherhood brought to her, praying that Mel will never suffer the fate she did of having to forsake Kino to keep her safe. Mel offers to avenge Kino alongside Ambessa, finally returning to Noxus in the process, and Ambessa once again attempts to deceive Mel by trying to get her to believe that her desire for ending the Black Rose comes not from vengeance, but from wariness of the danger they stand as. Ambessa simply tells Mel she's 'found another way' without going into detail.

Ambessa takes Mel further into the commune, revealing to her what she, Singed and Viktor are trying to do, I.E taking the former commune members and transforming them into soulless machines that never need fear death. It's then revealed that Viktor told Singed using his hivemind that the process for Warwick's glorious evolution can ensue. Sky, still incarnated in Viktor's mind, leaves him behind, allowing him to get on with his plan. Viktor tells Sky that he will miss her, to which she simply responds by saying 'No... You won't.' and disappearing. Singed begins injecting Warwick's corpse with fluids that will resurrect him, alongside Viktor's powers. During this process, all of Vander's life, all his memories of it are erased, including who he once was. All of the dead commune members are corrupted into machines, Warwick is resurrected, and Viktor transforms into his final form.

Your brother thought so too,

Your birth,
the entire course of your life,
was no accident.
She hid you because you are
that which she covets most:

[FOOTSTEPS RETREATING]
[SQUAWKS]
[SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING]
Jayce?
[EXHALES]
What happened to you?
Doesn't matter.
Something happened to me too.
You're the reason we
didn't die in the attack.
Apparently so.
How long have you known?
It started then.
Feelings I couldn't explain.
But this
I still don't fully understand.
Why just me? Why not save all of them?
It wasn't a decision. One moment
you're addressing the Council,
the next we're standing in rubble.
I didn't have any greater awareness.
How can I know you aren't lying to me?
Why would you think I am?
Because you used me,
and Viktor, for Hextech.
You called us "investments."
Two brilliant young inventors
who shared a penchant
for impossible surprises.
Carrying magic from myth to machine.
Rallying the hope and
hearts of a nation.
You were a wise investment.
Allow us a moment of civility, Jayce.
We must talk.
[JAYCE] Viktor.
How did you get in here?
You once benefitted from
my knowledge of this place.
That was a long time ago.
[VIKTOR] Had you given me the chance,
I would have shown you
the merits of my work.
Our work.
No, this is your obsession.
Everything you've done to
these people, you did alone.
[VIKTOR] Perhaps.
But I'm alone no longer.
I now speak with all their voices.
Say what you came here to say.
Somehow I think you already understand
what must transpire
to complete my mission.
I would prefer to do so in peace.
The Noxian has other intentions.
Mother?
The Arcane stirs within you.
[GRUNTING]
[GROANS]
[JAYCE] Viktor, for all our sakes,
stay away from the Hexgates.
[YELLS]
Your mind has become rigid, Jayce.
Fear clouds your judgment.
This chain of events started with you.
In my confusion, I was
unable to reconcile this.
But I now understand.
The Glorious Evolution is destined.
Let us instead do this
once again as partners.
My partner died in this room.
It was my sincere desire to avoid this.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]
[GRUNTING]
[YELLS]
[PANTING]
Doctor.
You may begin the process.
[MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING]
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[JINX SCOFFS]
[JINX] Go away.
You're too late.
[SILCO] Oh, it's a hell of a place.
It says something about the late Marcus
that he found imprisoning your sister
to be a greater mercy than killing her.
[JINX] Killing isn't mercy.
[SILCO CHUCKLES] A spark of rebellion
still burns inside that husk, I see.
No.
Killing is a cycle.
One that started long
before Vander and me.
And it will continue
long after the two of you.
I'm done running in circles.
We build our own prisons.
Bars forged of oaths,
codes, commitments.
Walls of self-doubt
and accepted limitation.
We inhabit these
cells, these identities,
and call them "us."
I thought I could break free by
eliminating those I deemed my jailors.
But
Jinx
I think the cycle only ends when
you find the will to walk away.
[VI] Jinx?
[JINX] What are you doing?
I swiped these from the guard station.
If you come, help, use all that
explosive potential of yours for good,
maybe we could rewrite your
story, like you did with Zaun.
What do you think?
[JINX] Sure, Vi.
[SOBS]
[JINX] You're never gonna
give up on me, are you?
[GROANS]
Hey!
You don't have to
worry about me anymore.
You don't need to feel
guilty about being happy.
You deserve to be with her.
Wait.
[JINX] There's no good version of me.
What are you gonna do?
Break the cycle.
Jinx!
[YELLING]
[JAYCE] I'm sorry.
I've been an idiot.
And an ass.
You're hurting too.
For as long as I can recall,
I have chased the
archetype of a Medarda.
I believed it my calling to
merit the blood in my veins.
It was all a lie.
This blood is alien to me.
Yet it has dictated the
course of my entire life.
I'm no more than a passenger.
A life I spent in self-pity.
Now it's gone.
I can never return to it.
I've been confused about a lot lately.
But there's one thing
I know in my bones.
There is no force in this world
that can control you.
You will never be a passenger.
[CROWD MURMURING]
[JAYCE] Quiet.
Forgive me.
But we don't have much time.
A storm is coming,
the likes of which Piltover,
perhaps Runeterra
itself, has never faced.
[GASPS]
[SOLEMN PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]
[JAYCE] This creature infiltrated
the very room you're standing in.
And we barely survived.
Hundreds more are on the way.
The Noxian general is leading them.
This isn't a fight for
ideals or territory.
It's a fight for humanity itself.
I'm asking
No, begging you, every one of you,
Topside and bottom,
to aid us in this coming war.
And it will be a war.
Now, this isn't a fair request,
but it is our only hope.
The forces against us are too great.
We need every hand we can get.
[SOLEMN MUSIC CONTINUES]
[ENFORCER] Bring them down!
[LOCK CLICKS]
We're abandoning the city's outskirts
to stage our defense at the Hexgates.
The final bastion of our salvation.
If you choose to flee,
don't stop running.
But I'm choosing to fight.
And I pray that you will join me.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[MADDIE] Just a moment.
Here, ma'am.
[MUSIC TURNS STIRRING]
[MUSIC FADES]
[BREATHING RAGGEDLY]
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[KEYS JINGLE]
Had a feeling I might find you here.
[VI] I really believed she'd help.
Say it.
You told me so.
I was an idiot to trust
her. I went behind your back.
I choose wrong every time.
And because of it, I've lost everyone.
You really think I needed all
the guards at the Hexgates?
Sorry to say, you've
grown a bit predictable.

Your brother was struck with curiosity.
He got caught in their web

Following her escape from the bunker and abandonment of Vi, Jinx burns down The Last Drop before returning to her hideout, whereupon she commits suicide by detonating a Hexgem-powered grenade while holding it. Ekko however arrives in the hideout and uses the Z-Drive to undo her suicide, before attempting to talk her down. At first he is unsuccessful, forcing him to repeatedly undo Jinx's suicide, but he eventually gets through to her by citing Heimerdinger's advice that it is never too late to build something new.

In a meeting room, Jayce holds a meeting between Caitlyn, Mel, and Vi about the upcoming invasion. Jayce plots to shut down the hexgates with the Enforcers' assistance. Caitlyn mentions that Viktor is at the center of all of this and then consoles the unnerved Vi.

Eventually, Vi rushes through a bridge dressed in heavy armor while dodging bullets as the war between Noxus and Piltover escalates. Inside the home base, Vi watches as Zaunite Gert, who volunteered to become an Enforcer, dies after succumbing to her injuries.

After Caitlyn snipes at Ambessa from the tower, Ambessa compliments her former student and signals to have a Shimmering soldier pull out Viktor's orb. Simultaneously, Jayce works tirelessly to turn off the hexgate piece by piece.

The Noxian soldiers manage to invade the Piltover tower, forcing the Enforcers to fight back, and Vi faces off against a Shimmering Noxian. Elsewhere, Caitlyn and her group make progress on their side as she spots, Steb and his group close by. They soon toss a gas canister out, use the fuming gas to ambush the Noxian soldiers, and Steb places a bomb on Viktor's orb, only to learn it's been sabotaged.

After the gas finally clears, Maddie is revealed to be a spy, and Ambessa confronts them. She takes Caitlyn's weapon from her, and Ambessa hugs Caitlyn while giving her one piece of advice. Ambessa then stabs Caitlyn in the side and leaves her to be killed by Maddie, who aimed and fired her gun at Caitlyn, but a barrier ricochets the bullet back at Maddie, killing her. A set of doors opens nearby, and Mel appears behind them and pleads with her mother to surrender, but Ambessa refuses.

At that moment, Jinx arrives on a hovercraft with reinforcements comprised of Zaunites led by Sevika and Firelights led by Ekko. Amid the battle, a single soldier manages to fire a large crate at Viktor's orb, but it was empty. Mel chastises her mother for what she's done to accomplish her goals, but Ambessa scoffs at it while rebuking her daughter's remarks. Caitlyn punches and then challenges her to a duel. As the duel between Caitlyn, Mel, and Ambessa progressed, Jinx and Ekko tried to protect Vi from Warwick.

Meanwhile, Jayce and Viktor debate their philosophical beliefs as Jayce continues trying to deactivate the gate, only for Viktor to reactivate it proximally.

The duel between Caitlyn and Ambessa continues as Ambessa seemingly has the upper hand against Caitlyn, who slashes off the magical ward off her right arm. This allows Mel to reveal the necklace given to her by the Illusionary Sorceress, who appears and entraps Ambessa in her magical thorns in her magical realm. However, Mel appears and betrays the Illusionary Sorceress by freeing her mother and listening to her final word before she dies in her arms.

Rushing toward Jinx after they crash into the clock tower, Vi pulls some rubble off of Jinx, and the two share a bonding moment together as Warwick confronts and fights the two. Over on Jayce's side, Viktor takes the Hexcore and levitates them to the rooftop. There, Viktor connects everyone in the area to the Astral plane.

There, Jayce and Viktor talk until Ekko uses his chrono hex crystal on Viktor's body. This causes a rift in his power, and Jayce states that he only wants his partner back. Viktor asks why Jayce would go so far for him after all he has done, to which Jayce replies that he made a promise to him, before gripping Viktor.

The scene changes to Jayce's previous meeting with the Mysterious Mage. After Jayce asks why the mage gave him the runestone after saving him and his mother from the blizzard, the mage reveals himself to be an older version of Viktor who had succeeded in bringing about his Glorious Evolution. The older Viktor explains that he had wanted to end suffering, but came to regret the Glorious Evolution after seeing how those "evolved" were left without dreams and ambitions. He claims that perfection brings only an end to pursuit, and that Jayce is the only one who could have convinced him of this, as multiple flashbacks of him giving Jayce the runestone play out in succession - each with a different rune carved into the stone - suggesting he has done so in multiple timelines and realities.

The younger Viktor is shown to have witnessed Jayce's meeting with his older counterpart. Realizing his folly, he attempts to undo the Glorious Evolution, a process that will destroy him; he urges Jayce to leave, but the other man decides to stay, and the two of them disappear into the arcane together. Within the real world, Viktor's mechanical soldiers collapse lifeless, while their captives are released from his control.

Within the Hexgate Tower, Vi finds herself stuck on an unstable walkway with an unconscious Warwick. Jinx urges her to jump to a nearby platform, claiming she cannot save their adoptive father, but Vi approaches Warwick's form and cries at having lost Vander once again. Warwick then wakes up and attacks Vi, but Jinx jumps and tackles him off the walkway before he can harm her. The action sends Jinx over the walkway's edge as well, but Vi manages to grab her sister's arm in one of her Hextech Gauntlets, while Warwick clings onto Jinx's body, his weight threatening to make the walkway collapse and send all three plummeting to their deaths. With Vi unable to pull her and Warwick up, and Warwick still murderous, Jinx chooses to sacrifice herself by snatching the gauntlet's Hexgem from it, preventing Vi from holding on to her and Warwick; as the two of them fall, Jinx embraces the beast that had once been her father before pulling out and detonating one of her grenades, seemingly killing them both.

Time passes by, and the lives of almost everyone after the war are shown. A joint memorial service for those killed is held by both Piltover and Zaun, taking place on the bridge separating the two cities. Ekko privately mourns away from the main ceremony, sitting in the same place he and the adult Powder kissed within the Alternate Universe. The Piltover Council is reformed with Sevika as one of its members, though two of the Piltover councillors are shown looking at her with disdain. Orianna, now inhabiting a mechanical body, observes a music box as Singed sits down next to her. A raven flies into the ruined Hexgate Tower and looks around, before revealing itself to have six eyes. Mel and Ambessa's forces leave Piltover for Noxus, Mel wearing Noxian attire and looking at the faceguard that once belonged to her deceased mother.

Within a parlor of the Kiramman Manor, Caitlyn - now wearing an eyepatch - studies the schematics for the Hexgate Tower while holding the remains of Jinx's grenade. Her expression becomes thoughtful when she notices a couple of air ducts within the tower - implying she suspects that Jinx may have survived the events there - before she smiles when she hears Vi humming a song from her childhood. Approaching Vi, who is sat on the edge of a coffee table near the room's fireplace, Caitlyn sits down next to her and teases the other woman about her uncharacteristic softness, with Vi claiming the song is one her mother used to hum. The Piltover woman then asks if Vi is still in "this fight", to which Vi declares that she is "the dirt under [Caitlyn's] fingernails", and that nothing will get rid of her.

Elsewhere, an airship is shown flying towards the horizon, before effects resembling those in Jinx's hallucinations flash across the screen, the words "The End" appearing for a brief moment.

Wait!
I just wanna talk to you.
Get out of here, Ekko.
I just
I just wanna talk to you, Pow
Jinx.
- You're too late, Ekko.
- Wait!
Always a dance with you.
I think I'm just gonna
sit here a minute.
You know, catch my breath.
See if I can talk an old
friend out of blowing us up.
- I'm tired of talking.
- No!
No! No! No
You know, I learned from someone
very special
that no matter what
happened in the past,
it's never too late
to build something new.
Someone worth building it for.
I need you and the Enforcers to
buy me as much time as you can
so I can shut down the Hexgates.
It's our only chance.
Viktor's at the center
of all this, isn't he?
We're meant to lose this fight.
If he reaches the Hexgates
Then we'd best stop him.
Move, move!
Reinforce the forward artillery.
We can't let them break through.
- Go.
- Let's go.
- Hold it.
- Go.
Reload.
- Give her some air.
- You're okay.
Down!
- Back!
- Come on.
Let's go.
Around the gate!
Bold, little one.
- Move your units and wait there.
- Stay.
Come on!
Let's go, let's go.
I warned you of the hazards
of professional entanglement.
Desperation is the
doorway to oblivion, child.
Let's get this over with.
I did appreciate your warmth.
If you care for me at
all, spare their lives.
There is nothing to gain
from this senseless bloodshed.
Still a fox.
Soldier.
Get in line.
Fire!
Let's run.
Hmm.
Where is Viktor?
Despite the circumstances, Jayce
I am pleased to see you.
There must be some part
of you still in there.
I am more than I ever was.
What other choice do we have?
Mother, look at the
price of your ambition.
You've sacrificed everything.
Rictus.
Kino.
This city I built for our family.
If it was for us, you
wouldn't have fought me.
You are no Medarda.
You remember your
Shut up and fight.
Vi!
Vi!
Vi!
It is the answer you and I
pursued all our lives.
An end to cruelty, injustice.
All of us our own authors
to an unbroken saga of progress.
To the benefit of all.
People deserve to
choose their own fates.
Choice is false.
It is how we clothe and forgive
the baser instincts
that spur us to division.
Death, war, prejudice.
Energy spent only to consume itself.
But we can be of one mind.
United.
You fought well, child.
Now!
A wolf has no mercy.
Your daughter is wiser than you credit.
I salute you, Ambessa.
For one without the gift,
you were quite a thorn.
What are you doing, sister?
I see your face, deceiver.
Sly girl.
You are the wolf.
Looks like you shouldn't have come back.
Still don't get it, huh, sis?
I'm always with you.
Even when we're worlds apart.
Stop this insanity, Viktor.
That is precisely my intention.
Your eyes won't lie
when your mind
is open, Jayce.
Vander.
Dad?
Do you see?
The sublime intersection
of order and chaos.
This is what you see?
This conflict.
This senseless waste.
I know their minds, Jayce.
They want better lives,
but emotion clashes with reason.
Humanity's self-corrupting
contradiction.
You've always wanted to cure
what you thought were weaknesses.
Your leg.
Your disease.
But you were never broken, Viktor.
There is beauty in imperfections.
They made you who you are.
An inseparable piece of everything
I admired about you.
That device can't be.
I thought I wanted us to
give magic to the world.
Now
all I want
is my partner back.
Why do you persist?
After everything I've done?
Because I promised you.
Why did you ever give me this?
Why?
I thought I could bring an
end to the world's suffering.
But when every equation was solved
all that remained
were fields of dreamless solitude.
There is no prize to perfection.
Only an end to pursuit.
In all timelines,
in all possibilities
only you
can show me this.
You must go, Jayce.
We finish this together.
Vi!
Vi, hurry, you can make the other ledge.
Vi!
What are you ?
Vi.
Vi?
You can't save him.
Vi!
Always with you, sis.
You may read about the war in Piltover.
But history is made palatably abstract.
For its truth
the agony of every sacrifice
the exaltation of every triumph
is more than one should bear.
We
whose decisions led us here,
will carry them forever.
Our only consolation
that with every loss,
we found some good,
some light,
worth gaining,
worth fighting for.
And though we are doomed to
revisit the error of our ways
spark ever more conflicts
our story isn't over.
Is that
singing?
It's just a tune my mother used to hum.
Are you still in this fight, Violet?
I am the dirt under your nails, cupcake.
Nothing's gonna clean me out.
